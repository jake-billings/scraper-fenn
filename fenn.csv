We are not into poetry as much as the memoir. We realize the clues are in the poem, but were wondering if there isn't at least one clue in each chapter. Thank you for a great book.  Sincerely, Emily.","Emily, All of the information you need to find the treasure is in the poem. The chapters in my book have very subtle hints but are not deliberately placed to aid the seeker. Good luck in the search. F"

Sometime theyâ€™ll find my bones and the treasure, but my bio will be inside the box, so at least theyâ€™ll know who I was... I just got tired of waiting... Itâ€™s difficult so it wonâ€™t be found right away, but itâ€™s easy enough so that itâ€™s not impossible to find it... I want sweaty bodies out there looking for my treasure â€” they just have to find the clues."
2019,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Will the poem lead you to the treasure?,Yes if you know where to start.
2026,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Are there clues in TTOTC book?,"Yes, because the poem is in the book."
2033,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Are there clues in TFTW book?,"Yes, because the map is in the book."
2040,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Are there subtle hints in the TTOTC book?,"Yes, if you can recognize them."
2047,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Were both trips made on the same day/date?,I made two trips from my car to the hiding place and it was done in one afternoon.
2054,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Are you willing to say whether the place of the treasure chest is the same as the one where you had previously plotted to have your bones rest forever?,Yes it is.
2061,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Is the blaze one single object?,In a word - Yes.
2068,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,I would like to know if the blaze can be found during the day without a flashlight.,I would say yes.
2075,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,Did the same 9 clues exist when you were a kid and to your estimation will they still exist in 100 years and 1000 years?,The clues did not exist when I was a kid but most of the places the clues refer to did. I think they might exist in 100 years but the geography probably will change before we reach the next millenia.
2082,unknown,http://dalneitzel.com/cheat-sheet/,N/A - Consolidated quotes appearing throughout the article.,"Some folks correctly mentioned the first two clues to me in an email and then they went right past the other seven, not knowing they had been so closeâ€_ Some of the searchers have been within 500 feet I knowâ€_ The person who finds the treasure will have studied the poem over and over, and thought, and analyzed and moved with confidence. Nothing about it will be accidental... I said on the Today show that the treasure is not associated with any structure. Some people say I have a desire to mislead. That is not true. There are no notes to be found or safety deposit boxes to be searched. The clues can lead you to the treasure, and it will be there waiting when you arrive... Playing a hunch is not worth much in the search and those who start out by looking for the blaze are wasting their time. "

The other day, I had 21 email requests. One man asked if he should buy a topographical map and I told him heâ€™d be better served reading the book again... All you have to do is think about the nine clues and follow them in order....Okay, Iâ€™ll tell you what I told a woman from Nevada who called and said she knew where the treasure was, but was incapacitated so would I please get it for her. I said, â€˜Well, you tell me where it is, and Iâ€™ll bring it to you.â€™ The woman wanted an additional clue so I told her itâ€™s more than 300 miles southwest of Toledo."

It continues to inspire. Do you have any advice for these new people? How should they begin the search six years after so many others? Do you feel they are at any disadvantage?","No, fresh eyes and new thinking might provoke a winning idea. I would advise new searchers to look for the clues in my poem and try to marry them to a place on a map. It seems like the longer one thinks about the search the more they complicate the problem."
2110,2/4/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-and-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt/,"Many people wonder about the autobiography sealed in the chest. Although tiny in size, it is sure to be an immense pleasure to read. Will there be any surprises for the reader?","About 1990 or so, I learned that my daughters (now ages 56 and 57) didnâ€™t know who Clark Gable was. I was shocked and thatâ€™s when I decided to record my family history (my autobiography). I wanted them to know as much as I could remember about my life and the events that largely shaped who I am today, and them, and theirs, in turn. I didnâ€™t have a computer so for several years I jotted remembrances in pencil on a yellow pad, starting with an incident that happened when I was about one. Yes, I remember it vividly. I donâ€™t think my story would be interesting to the average reader."

The title suggests information for the book would be difficult to discover. How did you come by the information? Can you share something interesting now?","I have largely retired from book writing, although I have three more in my computer, all over half finished. But my calendar is running out of pages and I am not distressed by realizing that no shelf will hold any of those books. I have largely retired from book writing, although I have three more in my computer, all over half finished. But my calendar is running out of pages and I am not distressed by realizing that no shelf will hold any of those books. The one I like best is Closet Stories of Taos. Itâ€™s a gossip book about the artists and characters who lived in that little town at the turn into the 20th century; Doughbelly Price. Mace McHorse, Long John Dunn, Teresita Ferguson, Arthur Manby, and the artists. During my gallery days I purchased the estates of several early Taos artists, and acquired the personal papers of a few more. Therein I learned the juicy flavors that make that book so interesting. I tell the story about Long John Dunn (very few people know that wasnâ€™t his real name). Everyone loved him although he killed two men in Texas. He was on trial for cattle rustling but jumped through a window and on the first horse he saw. And he picked up a rope that was lying on the ground, and made good his escape through a thunderstorm of bullets and bad language. He said he was miles down the road before he realized there was a horse tied to the rope he picked up."
2124,2/4/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-and-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt/,"Iâ€™m wondering if you could create a day, what would it be filled with? Is there something you wanted to explore but the opportunity never presented itself to fully take hold of? And then Iâ€™m wondering if you would be willing to share what a day in your life is like now? Do you wish it to be different in anyway or do you feel the contentment of a life being well lived?","Jenny, I must laugh at the question. My answer begs you to give me forty more years of life and see what happens. My 86 years of experiences have filled my mind with many things I would like to do. There is so much to be learned by failing, and I may be the worldâ€™s leading authority on that subject. My days now are filled with tending to domestic chores, an occasional lunch with friends, and compensating."
2131,2/4/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-and-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt/,"Iâ€™ve heard our adorable Little Girl from India decided to start writing a Little Kid from PeÃ±asco. They are fully enjoying and excitedly exploring areas they feel your treasure poem could lead to. Theyâ€™ve researched via maps, history books, and the internet. However, since she has been told she canâ€™t get closer than two clues to the treasure, sheâ€™s planning a trip to not only personally meet the Little Kid from PeÃ±asco, but to search the Rockies for your treasure. How do you imagine their search will go? Can she now find the treasure?","Some of those kids from PeÃ±asco are very bright. The treasure will be found by someone who followed the clues to the location. To me, that is the only plausible recipe."
2138,2/4/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-and-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt/,"The following quote inspires me to do more and to realize each moment of the day spent is an investment into what we leave behind;Â â€˜The Goal isnâ€™t to live forever but to create something that willâ€™.Â Youâ€™re living a grand life, and have created things which will live on when gone. Besides the Chase, which I know fills hearts around the world, what are some other investments made in your life which offer warm smiles to you now, knowing they were worthwhile and will live on too?","Thanks for that Jenny. My family has been my biggest investment and has brought the most important rewards. My memory is filled with little pleasures that are renewed every time I think of them. I remember when my two daughters were about 12 and 13. They were doing little irritating things that kids that age do. One was staying up too late, and another was talking on the phone too much. Our home phone was also our business phone, and we had only one line. So one day I called them together for a meeting. I told them that I was proud of the way they were conducting themselves. I said,Â â€œBecause you are so responsible your mother and I have decided to let you make all of the decisions related to your personal life. But if we discover that you canâ€™t handle those responsibilities we will continue making decisions for you.â€ùÂ It was so funny, because they seemed to grow up overnight. They stopped doing most of the things that were irritating to me. I guess all families have similar stories. Plus, some learned people will diss me for saying this, but I believe not having much of a education gave me an advantage in some important ways. Not knowing what I was doing forced me to learn fast, and to not test the depth of the water with both feet. A few very important breaks luckily came to me accidentally.The military taught me discipline, gave me purpose, and demanded a good work code. Being a fighter pilot taught me to think fast and to depend on myself because most of the time there no one else was around. Owning a retail business taught me to hire people who were smarter than I was, and then sit down and leave them alone.My assets are not unique to me but I was savvy enough to take advantage of what I had: imagination and guts, an awesome twosome. I had the ability to make important decisions right now and the wisdom to change them just as fast if necessary. And I was willing to hustle hard. One of my rules was, â€œShow me a man who owns a business and works an eight hour day, and Iâ€™ll show you a failure.â€ù"
2145,2/4/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-and-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt/,"After each yearâ€™s questions, I begin to think â€˜oh maybe I should have asked that one insteadâ€™ or â€˜I wonder if you would have rather answered something else.â€™ So my last question now is to ask â€˜is there a question you would like me to ask, and then will you answer it? Iâ€™m always just so honored to share your words and I donâ€™t want to limit any you might want to share with everyone.","Jenny, you are a dichotomy in its greatest moment, and an aberration also. Your mind is always seeking and planning alternatives. Reminds me of the reporter who asked,Â â€œOther than that Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show.â€ùÂ I have studied your web site and seen how you are so in control. I have spent hours with you and your husband, and have noticed how well you use understatement to your advantage. I think you are baiting me with your question, but I will answer it anyway. I see a rare opportunity so I must give this question a lot of thought.\n\nHmmm. OK:\n\nForrest, You seem to have a lot of confidence and believe you can do anything. Do you think you could have been good artist?\n\nAnswer: NO.\n"

The overwhelming support of â€˜Fennersâ€™ to bring him home reveals the altruism this group embraces. A powerful, loyal, and admirable community, not only in this time of trial, but at other times too, has been created and realized. Did you ever expect the Thrill of the Chase to develop and bring together such an honorable bunch?","Yes Jenny, because thatâ€™s who we are as a people. When times get tough we gather together and help each other. Before Pearl Harbor, when a senior Japanese general was asked what he thought about invading America. He advised against it. He said, â€œâ€_because there will be a bullet behind every blade of grass.â€ù"
2159,2/4/16,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-with-forrest-fenn-over-five-years-of-the-thrill-of-the-chase/,"Your memoir, The Thrill of the Chase, was released in the fall of 2010, and so it has been over five years since you first offered the choice to get out, explore, enjoy, and find your million-dollar treasure. Numerous people have taken you up on that dare and have experienced adventures of a lifetime. They might not have found your chest of gold, but they have discovered treasures of a different kind. How does knowing this affect you? Is the Chase living up to your original wish for it?","The value of the treasure seems to change with everyone who writes about it, but that doesnâ€™t matter. I feel personally rewarded by knowing that maybe 65,000 people have ventured into the Rocky Mountains looking for the gold and jewels. Nearly all who write me say that the thrills and adventures are more than worth their effort, and many plan to return again."

That the moment you thought about hiding the chest, you knew right where you were going to conceal it. Iâ€™m sure you have other places you consider special. Would you be willing to share some of these, and why you find them so?","No other hiding place was ever seriously considered Jenny. There are places near where I grew up that are dear to me, just like everyone else. If I had it all to do over again the results would be the same, and I canâ€™t think of anything I would change. I feel fortunate that my poem said exactly what I wanted it to say."

Should they be deterred? Can a little girl in India, who speaks good English, but only has your poem and a map of the US Rocky Mountains, work out where the treasure is? And would she be confident as she solves each clue, or only confident when she has solved them all?","I wish I had another treasure to hide in the Appalachians. The little girl in India cannot get closer than the first two clues. There are many disabled people who are deeply into maps and geography, and they are having a lot of fun."

People from across the world are searching for your treasure and are determined to not stop searching until it is found. They are fully enjoying the Thrill of the Chase and are in for the long term, if need be. What thoughts, advice, reminders, etc. would you like to most offer them?","I applaud those who are staying in the search, and enjoying what nature has to offer. I will reiterate that the story is real, the chest is where I left it, and it is not in a dangerous place. At age 85 I could go back and get it. But any place can become dangerous for anyone who violates the common sense rules of the chase. Stay out of the mountains in the winter time when it is cold and snow covers the ground.f"

Considering the many years the hunt has been going on, and from your perspective and interaction with searchers, do you feel searchers are becoming closer to solving the clues to the treasure, or further away? Do you feel over time, some searchers have forgotten beginning basics or thoughts they once had, and might benefit going back to them?","Thereâ€™s a lot brain power being expended on the blogs by some pretty bright people Jenny, and it seems they are having fun. But the great preponderance of searchers donâ€™t comment publically. Very few tell me exactly where they are looking so I donâ€™t know how close they are to the treasure. Iâ€™ve said searchers should go back to the poem so many times that I donâ€™t want to say it again here."

What do you enjoy most about writing these?Â  I know we all love them lots!","In those stories Iâ€™m just looking back and talking to myself most of the time. Itâ€™s fun to be reminded of details I had almost forgotten. Hopefully, readers 500 years from now will find my tales entertaining."

Thank you.Â  But has The Thrill of the Chase given this to you as well?Â  How has the Chase affected you over these years?","I wrote that book when I was full of wishful thinkings. I wanted to get people interested, energized, and outside. That has happened in such a way that now I live my life vicariously through what I have motivated them to do."

During times when I was focused, thinking, and working long hours, I thought that was the only way. Now my wife and I are contented in our singular space where tranquility is important. Maybe itâ€™s just an age thing. I could make an argument to the contrary also."

Do you ever consider sliding into the background of the hunt and saying nothing? And would you rather be remembered for giving a treasure away now or remembered to have hidden a treasure for all to continuously seek and enjoy in the Chase?","It might be better for me to move farther away from the story Jenny, but I have never been a successful bystander. What searchers say and think is interesting to me. No one is giving the treasure away. Whoever finds it will have paid their dues and earned the prize. When that happens is incidental, and it is of no consequence that I be remembered. But it is important that the mystery and intrigue of the story continues to excite families and motivate them to get out into the mountains. That has always been my goal."

Reporting on your extraordinary treasure hunt, it resulted in an explosion of new seekers from all across the world. What are some of your thoughts about the flurry of activity over the past year?Â  Did the excitement towards the Chase surprise you in any way? Does it make you think the chest might be found earlier than first thought?","It is interesting to know that a great number of people are out there searching. Many are giving serious thought to the clues in my poem, but only a few are in tight focus with a word that is key. The treasure may be discovered sooner than I anticipated."

Even though these hopes were in your mind when writing the book and poem, what are you finding most rewarding about them?",One man said he and his brother dug for buried treasures when they were kids in North Carolina but had not spoken in 25 years. He said he read my book and called his brother. Now they are reunited and searching for my treasure. Children have the greatest imagination because their thoughts run free.
2250,2/4/14,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-more-with-forrest-fenn/,,After my Thrill of the Chase book was published my Too Far to Walk book begged to be written. It was easy because I just told some stories and illustrated them with photos from my scrap books. I would encourage everyone to write their memoir. The hardest part is sitting down and getting started.
2257,2/4/14,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-more-with-forrest-fenn/,"I feel each person finds himself drawn to a different place; for me it is the beach.Â  I love the warmth of the sun mixed with a cooling breeze and the humbling feeling I get while looking endlessly out into the ocean and listening to the waves. You mention inÂ The Thrill of the ChaseÂ it is the mountains which continue to beckon you, and that they always will.Â  What is it about the mountains that make them so special for you?Â  And when did you first realize it?",The mountains are full of activity that fills me with wonder.Â  One of my earliest recollections as a boy was to turn over a rotting log in the forest and watch as a hundred little critters scurried around trying to decide what to do. Itâ€™s nature in its rawest moment. I find solace in the solitude of the trees.
2264,2/4/14,http://mysteriouswritings.com/six-questions-more-with-forrest-fenn/,"The meticulous work documented and described in your book,Â The Secrets of San Lazaro Pueblo, certainly express an appreciation and respect for the past.Â  You mention, â€œEach artifact that is not recovered is a book that will not be read.â€ùÂ  What do you hope to yet learn or find there? And while discovering the past, do you feel our modern ways are missing out on earlier enjoyments?",Archaeologists today donâ€™t like to excavate. Their motto is: â€œSave the Past for the Future.â€ù I think thatâ€™s short sighted. For me the future is five minutes from now. We unearthed the only pre-historic kachina dance masks ever found in the Southwest. Archaeologists said they didnâ€™t exist in prehistoric times. So we corrected some misinformation. The past should not have to wait for us any longer.

I, and many others, have enjoyed them.Â  In many of your books, interviews, etc., you so often share beautiful words filled with timeless wisdom. Would you be willing to share a few more that hold special insights or thoughts you hold close?",It is fun to arrange words in such a way that you have to smile at the end of a sentence. \n\nAutobiographers always lean toward the subject.\n\nIt is important that I drink a martini at least once a year so I can continue to remember why I donâ€™t like them.\n\nAll that I could remember was that I was not supposed to forget something.

Those stories gave it ignition. The hidden treasure story in the book provided enough propulsion to keep it in the public view long enough for word of mouth traffic to broaden its desire across America and beyond. I am more than pleased with the way it has been accepted.Â  What I didnâ€™t expect was the number of people who immediately started searching maps and using Google Earth to locate their special spots.

I wondered who made it and caused it to be resting at my feet for 1,000 years, waiting for me to pick it up. I still feel the excitement of that day.\n\nIn the Saharan desert of Libya I discovered thousands of war relics left over from the tank battles of WW-II: burned out tanks and shell casings were everywhere.

When it is discovered I hope it is by some deserving person who is emotionally involved and has been rewarded by the other mountain thrills that come with the chase. If it is not found for several hundred years that would be fine with me.\n\nOne thing is certain, when a person discovers that beautiful bronze chest and opens it for the first time and sees the bracelet with hundreds of rubies, emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, and the 265 gold coins and hundreds of placer nuggets, he will be in awe. It is easy for me to predict the expression on his their face."

It came to me at age eighty as though my entire life had been waiting for that moment. The bulk of the book was written in six weeks and phrases that I had never thought of before, suddenly appeared on my computer screen. I said in the forward that the book wrote itself. I had written seven books before this one, and it seemed that none of the lines crossed where they were supposed to, metaphorically speaking.\n\nI donâ€™t feel qualified to give advice but a few ideas that I would like to say have guided me are:\n\nStay in your job only if you love it.\nGet out in the mountains and turn a log over to see whatâ€™s there.\nAvoid those things that distract you from your self esteem.\nThe key word is contentment. If you can find it, everything else has already fallen in place."

I will answer the questions as presented and not judge them. I will also leave your students with a poem. It is not a reflection on anyone, or the questions, but something for them to think about.\n\nToday as I went up the stair, I met a man who wasnâ€™t there.

What, you donâ€™t want to take your pants down?...Iâ€™ve said many times that everything about my poem and my book is straightforward...I didnâ€™t think I was very smart, but I didnâ€™t have to be smart to figure out that my parents werenâ€™t really proud of me...I felt I wasnâ€™t worth anything...I told myself that if I was going to compete in that environment, I couldnâ€™t do it intellectually, but I could out-hustle all these guys (Air Force Pilots)...I had this nightmare about a year ago where I was told that the government knew exactly how many people I killed, and they were going to tell me...Because I had a hard tour in Vietnam, I wanted the world to stop and let me out. Santa Fe was the only place I knew where I could wear Hush Puppies and blue jeans and make a living....Then I got back into bed and started thinking. If I have an advantage over everyone, itâ€™s that I think a lot. So I told myself that from now on, I was going to wake up at 7 in the morning, lay in bed till 8, and think....Let me tell you something that may startle you. Iâ€™ve never been interested in art. Art to me was always a commodity. If you say that out loud, everybody will throw rocks at you. Itâ€™s like cussing in church.â€_ But I looked at it as a business instead of a love. I never loved art, and thatâ€™s what gave me an advantage....If you like it less because itâ€™s a fake, who is the fraud now?...My rule was, I didnâ€™t want to do anything for over 15 years...If Robert Redford had ever written anything he probably could have done it better than the guy who wrote that Gatsby book...."

Now, you take a big swig (Jackie Kennedy's brandy), Iâ€™m gonna punch you out. So, do you feel different now? See, when I look at you taking a sip of this, I would think of you feeling like youâ€™re on a different plateau. Because youâ€™re part of it now. Instead of being a spectator, youâ€™re a player....Youâ€™re talking about legacy? People ask me about that a lot, and I have to say that I donâ€™t feel that way. My philosophy is that when Iâ€™m gone, who cares anymore? If I died this week, it would not bother me at all if no one ever mentioned my name again....You can throw the word legacy back at me again. I was thinking about it last night. Maybe youâ€™re right... See the F carved in there? Thatâ€™s my initial. There were other Fâ€™s there, but theyâ€™re obliterated now... If I get Alzheimerâ€™s, Iâ€™m going to flag my calendar for six months from now and do it my own way. Hopefully at my last dying gasp I will still go back to that place and die at my favorite â€_"

Fortunately, today he turned up safe and confused in Missoula. There are webcams all over the country these days. They give you live weather reports in living color. I just checked the one at Old Faithful and found it snowing with vis about 400 feet. Still, there were about 15 people walking around. The park is closed to all but snowmobiles. I like to check the Yellowstone Giant Screen webcam because off in the distance I see an orange railcar that is parked adjacent to the building where I sometime showered as a kid. I didnâ€™t do it very often because it cost 50 cents. Bathing in the Madison and Firehole Rivers was free. Many searchers told me the general area in which they are looking. I didnâ€™t read the long emails, but in most of the short ones I looked for key words that would get my attention. Several did this year and I hope my lack of an email response was not taken as a clue. It is hard to know how many individuals were treasure hunting this summer, but my guess is between 40 and 50,000, most in New Mexico and least in Colorado. Of course I read the many short emails from families who told me and sent photos of their great adventures in the mountains. Thanks to those people. Hunting reports have slowed to a crawl now that the search areas are mostly shut down for the winter.\n\nMerry Christmas everyone and please be safe. f"

Some would have used the latter in this context, which would have been incorrect, although debatable in some classrooms. I probably would not have thought to use your word, which is accurate, but arguable by those who are naturally bent to disagree.\n\nHere is my take on the subject, and I offer it hoping no one will research my opinion. If Iâ€™m wrong please donâ€™t tell me because Iâ€™m too old to change my mind.\n\nThe laws of physics insinuate that joining a ferrous metal to a non-ferrous metal is difficult, but may be accomplished with the use of a heliarc, which uses an inert gas that keeps oxygen away from the joining process. When heated to a high temperature iron will start to oxidize before it melts, where bronze will not.\n\nSo the secret to marrying the two metals is to keep the iron from oxidizing, thus making the two compatible. The inert gas does that. Thatâ€™s my story and it always worked for me when I had a foundry, although some guys who are smarter than I am said I couldnâ€™t do it. f"

The other sherd is light colored clay with burnt umber, black and cream color for the design.  The gray sherd on its broken side shows many impurities that could cause breakage, while the lighter colored sherd has a more refined composition and is thicker.\n\nMy question is, â€œDid the clay for one or both come from San Lazaro or was the clay brought in from another site? ~ thanks BW","Well, let me answer with what you gave me to work with. The gray colored clay may be from a biscuit ware bowl. The clay comes from near Abiquiu. The black paint is made from Rocky Mountain Bee Weed, which grows all over the southwest. The color is brown, but turns black when fired.\n\nThe â€œimpuritiesâ€ù are not that at all, they are temper, which keeps many of the pots from breaking during the firing process. The temper may be ground-up pot sherds, or sand.\n\nThe umber colored designs on the other sherd are made from galena, which is lead ore. It is mined about 20 miles south of San Lazaro. The ore is ground up and mixed with water, and heated until it gets a thick viscosity, then it is painted on. Both the mineral and vegetal paints become permanent when the vessel is fired.

However, since you have told us it is above 5000 feet, in a funny way you have put a limit on if it was buried, how deep it would be. For example, if we were at 5002 feet altitude, it could be no more that 2 feet down. However, it we were at 8002 feet, it could be as deep at 3002 feet! That would be tough to do in one afternoon!\n\nSo my question is without making any comment as to whether it is buried or not, can you refine the limit? For example, would it be less than 1 foot? It would seem to help if searchers who believed it was buried didnâ€™t unnecessarily dig deep holes. ~ Thanks Mark","To follow your line of reasoning Mark, if the treasure was in Death Valley, CA, which is 282 feet below sea level, the chest would have to be floating in the air at least 5,282 feet above the ground.

Humans feel an inherent apprehension when theyâ€™re around alligators, so the natural tendency is to stay out of biting range. Twice a week I fed Elvis and Beowulf beef liver. Beowulf would swim up and take it his food from my hand. He was a gentleman. It was Elvis I had to watch, and although he was just two feet long, when he smelled the liver he would lunge at my hand. He reminded me of a math teacher I had in high school.\n\nOne early winter day I was looking for Beowulf because it was time to put him in his winter quarters where the water was slightly heated. Elvis was already there enjoying the warmth. I finally found Beowulf under some lily pads and grabbed him by his tail. He was about 4 feet long and I expected him to thrash and resist his capture. Instead, he was lethargic, didnâ€™t move at all. His eyes and mouth were closed. I think he was just cold.\n\nWhen I sold our gallery, the new owner was showing her insurance agent around the property. They opened the gate leading to the pond just in time to see Beowulf chasing a fat duck across the yard. That did it for the two reptiles and they were shipped to a bayou in Louisiana.

Maybe someone will ask me about one of those ideas.â€ù\n\nSo Iâ€™m asking, what are some of those ideas?  ~Thanks ~ Thrill","Especially burned into my memory Thrill, was the idea to arrange a cultural exchange program with the Russian government. A few art scholars jazzed me pretty good and I was the butt of some funny jokes, because it was 1975 and the Cold War was in full blast.\n\nThrough Armand Hammer and Occidental Petroleum I met Madam Betrova who was the Russian Minister of Culture for Western and American Affairs. She took me to the circus in Moscow and we made a hand-shake deal while the acrobats were swinging through the air.\n\nWe agreed to a five-year cultural exchange program. As a result of that meeting and lots of telexes going back and forth, I visited seven Russian museums and picked out thirty-six paintings by the Russian/American painter Nicolai Fechin. One was a very large portrait of Vladimir Lenin. The show opened at Fenn Galleries Ltd in Santa Fe with Madam Betrova and various government officials from Washington and Moscow in attendance.\n\nWhen our show closed we traveled the exhibition to museums in Cody and Seattle. Then our gallery borrowed thirty-six Fechin paintings from American museums and private collections, including our own, and sent them to three Russian cities for exhibition.\n\nThe show cost me some tears, a bunch of money, a fight with the State Department, and lots of sleepless nights. But it was favorably reviewed internationally and Fechinâ€™s top work has sold in recent years for over $2,000,000."

I didnâ€™t know how to make feet so I made the poor thing stand in mud.\n\nYears ago I made a life-mask of my daughter Zoe, and sculpted her head and shoulders, and cast it in bronze. No one liked it but me, and Zoe claimed it wasnâ€™t really her face. I placed the portrait on my deck up stairs, where it was promptly stolen. It made me feel pretty good that some thief liked my work enough to take it.\n\nI learned later that it was sold for scrap metal.

I certainly didnâ€™t know any movie stars then and we didnâ€™t subscribe to any magazines if my memory serves me.\n\nI donâ€™t remember who the first celebrity we sold to was, but there were a lot of them. The biggest sale probably was Steven Spielberg who purchased an expensive Charlie Russell bronze. Others were Cher, Jonathan Winters, David Rockefeller, Michael Douglas, Ethyl Kennedy, Lee Marvin, Robert Redford, Sam Shepard, Donald Rumsfeld, Rock Hudson, Shirley MacLean, Suzanne Somers, Steve Martin, Calvin Kline, Karen Allen, Ralph Lauren, Jackie Kennedy, John Connelly and Roger Miller.

It brings back memories.\n\nI had a hard year in Vietnam. All alone and hiding in the Laotian jungle after being shot down for the second time gave me time to think. The AF gave me $150 combat pay and the same for flying. That brought my total income to about $1,000 a month. There had to be something better for me, even with no education.\n\nSo I taught myself to cast bronze and built my own equipment. During the next two years I made $180,000 in my garage after working 50 hours a week for the Air Force. That told me I could do it, so I turned down a promotion and retired from the military. Two years later my family moved to Santa Fe and slept on the floor while we plastered the walls of our gallery.\n\nLuck brought me to the right place at the right time with the right product. I kept reminding me that art was a commodity and artists were manufacturers. Thatâ€™s what kept my feet on the ground and gave me an edge over my competitors who â€œabsolutely loved art.â€ù New Mexico Business Journal wrote a cover story on that subject.\n\nMy lack of experience and art smarts were more than offset by my imagination, guts, logical mind, and willingness to work. Thatâ€™s an awesome recipe.\n\nAnd, while I have you here Iâ€™ll give you some advice, which wonâ€™t work for everyone. If you donâ€™t like your job, get out fast and work for yourself. Think!

Sometimes you just have to go with a gut instinct and have faith in human nature. No one can be an expert on every subject, and it pays to have a little street moxie. Experience helps also.\n\nOnce a trader named Alphonse came to see me. He always had a few interesting antiques and I enjoy bartering with him. This time he offered me what he said was Napoleonâ€™s skull and he wanted $10,000 for it.

I always do what she says.\n\nThat story reminds me of something that happened a few years ago. Iâ€™ve learned to look at traders with a jaundiced eye, but am cognizant that provenience is important.\n\nSo when Alfredo Luciana offered me the knife that killed Caesar and showed me a notarized letter from an important Italian general, I was suitably impressed.

She was just inside the screen door and yelled at me, â€œForrest, what are you doing?â€ù I said, â€œnothing mom, just shooting at a bear.â€ù She suggested something to the effect that I should try not to get my clothes dirty. After a few more minutes she walked out and looked at me. I had a little bow and arrow set; and the arrows had round red plungers on the tip so that when I licked them and shot at a wall, the arrow would stick to it.\n\nBut a tiny black bear cub was about five feet up a tree and I was standing almost beside it shooting arrows that bounced off its hair. It was great fun picking the arrows up and shooting the bear again, and again. He just looked at me in total bewilderment, but I think he enjoyed the attention.\n\nMy mom scarfed me up and ran in the house and slammed the door. For the next few minutes she explained that the cute little cubâ€™s mommy was probably around there some place and she might not appreciate me trying to kill her son. â€œBesides,â€ù she said, â€œkilling bears is against the law and I was lucky the sheriff didnâ€™t see me because the food in the jail was terrible and they didnâ€™t serve hot dogs,â€ù or words to that effect.\n\nBlack bears were numerous around town in those days and I donâ€™t remember anyone being hurt by them.

I think the music from that instrument is the most soothing. It also may be healing. I would be the worldâ€™s greatest cellist were it not for talent because I have everything else, desire, patience, motivation, willingnessâ€_ Once, in the starry-dark of night, I heard a cello in the far-faint distance. It sounded like the moan of a mountain wind beaconing me.\n\nI regret that I waste so much time. Iâ€™m horribly inefficient and that means at times Iâ€™m lazy. There are three books in my computer that probably wonâ€™t be finished, although Closet Stories of Taos might be my best writing effort. Itâ€™s about 60% complete. At the bottom of my thoughts it seems so empty now. Perhaps Iâ€™ve reached the point in my life where Iâ€™m more interested in the pie crust than the filling.\n\nI regret that I wasnâ€™t able to start thinking earlier in my life. My time in the Air Force was regimented. For twenty-years I leased my life to a cause and there was little personal time to think for my own benefit. The morning after my retirement I got out of bed at 0500 and my wife asked where I was going? I realized that I didnâ€™t have any place to go and it was a shock. So I crawled back into bed and started thinking, and I made a rule. From now on I would wake 0700 every morning and do nothing but think in bed until 0800. My mind would be fresh, the phone wouldnâ€™t ring and nobody would knock on my door. That may be the best decision I ever made as so many good ideas have come to me during that hour. Maybe someone will ask me about one of those ideas.\n\nI regret that I didnâ€™t spend more time with my parents, especially after they reached their middle 70s and later. I was trying to build a business and perhaps my sense of propriety was fading with the hardship of toil. How punitive it seems to me now.

Just a few things I needed to watch the Broncos play the Cowboys: pepperoni, bologna, Tabasco, salami and horseradish.\n \nAs I approached the check out counter, a shapely twentyish-looking woman raced past me. Her pushcart was loaded with six-packs of Corona beer. She wore tight shorts and slosh sandals, but it was her large hair â€“ garish red and full of curlers â€“ that struck me. The curlers were mostly white but a few were brown, and her piercings and tattoos introduced me to a world I had rarely seen before. I told myself I had to get out more.\n\nAs I slowed my cart to prevent a wreck, Mz Fashion Maven gave me a grin that said my 83 years were no match for her youth and exuberance. The checkout line moved slowly and the delay gave me time to observe Mz Maven, who seemed to be annoyed by my preoccupation with the objects that decorated her hair. As we stood there looking at each other, I politely asked, pointing to her hair, â€œHow many stations can you get on that thing?â€ù\n\nWow! I quickly regretted the question as the color in her face started to match her hair tint. Suddenly she looked like she had an itch in a place she couldnâ€™t scratch. It really bothered me when she yelled, â€œHow dare youâ€_!â€ù (expletives deleted) in a loud and commanding voice. When all of the shoppers started staring at me, I wanted them to see that my hands were in my pockets and had been there for a long time. I was embarrassed and started backing away. Outside I watched from behind a truck of watermelons until Mz Maven loaded her supplies beside a chainsaw in her pickup truck. As she pulled out, I saw she had a bumper sticker that read: Practice Beauty & Random Acts of Pleasure.\n\nI munched on saltine crackers while the Broncos beat the Cowboys by three points.

My mom let me smell the different spices and herbs as she stirred them into recipes she was making. I enjoyed the interaction with my mom, and the wrinkles in my nose indicated to her how much I liked or disliked each aroma.\n\nJust so youâ€™ll know the difference, spices are dried seed, root, fruit, bark or vegetable substances. Herbs are seeds, roots, leaves, flowers, resin, and berries. OK?\n\nSo I removed my wifeâ€™s metal spice drawer from the cabinet. It was heavy so I rested it on our kitchen table. When I sat and pulled the drawer toward me something sharp on the bottom scraped a gash on the wooden tabletop. Iâ€™ll try to fix it with wax before my wife gets home. I hate those things when they happen and I canâ€™t blame them on my dog."

I read the labels and sniffed the contents of each jar. Then I stuck my finger in each spice to taste the flavor. Itâ€™s funny how some smells are so different from the way they taste. If you donâ€™t believe me, just go in the pantry and smell your vanilla. Youâ€™ll love it enough to take another whiff, but donâ€™t take a taste, and thatâ€™s fair warning.\n\nI quickly learned that some spices smell like others so I donâ€™t know why a cook needs so many different kinds. Most didnâ€™t make much of an impression but here are some notes and observations about those that did.\n\nTurkish Ground Cumin\nâ€œUse on Middle Eastern & Mexican dishes.â€ù  They say itâ€™s a must but it doesnâ€™t do much for me. If I ever try any Middle Eastern dishes I probably wonâ€™t like them. I love Mexican food but Iâ€™m not going to put this stuff on my enchiladas.\n\nCloves\nSmells bizarre and strong. The taste has a bite that comes with a lasting sting. It took three seconds to feel the full impact of the flavor on my tongue. It was terrible. I felt jaundiced and had to suck on an ice cube. Stay away from cloves â€“ thatâ€™s my advice. Are you sure itâ€™s something to eat and not some kind of disinfectant?"

I think you put it on spaghetti, but maybe not. Some herb makes spaghetti sauce good though. Oregano has a bitter taste and it numbed my tongue a little. I know itâ€™s used on pizza. I like pizza if it has pepperoni, cheese, bell peppers, onions, anchovies and oregano on it.\n\nPoppy Seeds\nâ€œAncient civilizations used them to add color and texture to food.â€ù Yeah, I know whatâ€™s made out of  poppy seeds and it doesnâ€™t need color or texture. It might be embarrassing to have this little jar in my house if the drug enforcement guys come nosing around. Iâ€™ll speak with my wife about it.\n\nMace\nItâ€™s smell is stronger than itâ€™s taste. Makes me suspicious. â€œUse on puddings and spinach,â€ù it says. I think the person who wrote that may have been sniffing poppy seeds. It says mace grows on the same tree with nutmeg and it tastes warm. OK, I like things that taste warm.\n\nGarlic Powder\nWhen I unscrewed the lid, fine white powder spilled all over my lap. It smelled like something that might rust the lid. I donâ€™t like garlic unless itâ€™s on toasted bread and Iâ€™m eating spaghetti. Itâ€™s fun to grow garlic in my garden because itâ€™s educational to watch."

Why would anyone want two full jars of cloves?\n\nAnise Seeds\nThese are cute little gray seeds but hard to bite. They taste like liquorice. The label says something about pastries but is faded and I couldnâ€™t read more. Itâ€™s probably okay. When I was a kid people tried to give me soft sticks of liquorice. They came in black and an ugly red/maroon color. Maybe thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t like liquorice then. I probably still donâ€™t.\n\nPaprika\nI canâ€™t tell if I like it or not. Itâ€™s the â€œGround dried pod of the sweet chili pepper.â€ù Thatâ€™s what the label says and I really donâ€™t care one way or the other. â€œMix lemon juice, celery, crab and mayonnaise together and spoon into hollowed tomatoes, or use as a sandwich spread.â€ù Sounds like something they serve in expensive restaurants. Not for me, but thanks anyway.\n\nCayenne\nâ€œA dash awakens dips, soups, salads, sauces and entrees.â€ù Awakens? (maybe thatâ€™s a typo) I used to like a little cayenne pepper on Texas chili but havenâ€™t tried it in a while. Maybe I should stop reading the labels.\n\nLemon Pepper\nItâ€™s made of ground lemon peel and â€œhardy coarse-ground pepper.â€ù I absolutely love it on grilled steaks and hamburgers. They say it has Riboflavin in it for color. I canâ€™t imagine why anyone would want to add color to a hamburger. Sometimes I sprinkle a little Lemon Pepper on my arm and lick it. All of my grandkids think Iâ€™m weird, except maybe little Piper."

I donâ€™t dare taste it. When the label suggested that I put it on squash that was enough for me. I screwed the green lid back on that jar and hid it on the bottom of the pile. I wonder if my neighbor would like to have it.\n\nGround Turmeric\nâ€œBelongs to the ginger family.â€ù I donâ€™t want to talk about it. The label doesnâ€™t say what it is but something in there is dead. Google says itâ€™s active ingredient is curcumin and itâ€™s used to treat cancer. You probably need a prescription to buy it. Iâ€™m throwing this stuff out fast. I think I need to speak with my wife again.\n\nPickling Spice\nâ€œUse with boiling beets, sour beef, pickling and cabbage.â€ù I just donâ€™t know what to say. Iâ€™ll bet someoneâ€™s making a fortune with these things.\n\nGround Cardamom\nThis one is pungent. â€œYou can add it to hamburgers and espresso.â€ù I would never use it on both. I use onions when I want pungent and I donâ€™t drink espresso. Itâ€™s a drink for girls.\n\nRosemary\nYou should sprinkle it on the charcoal just before you start grilling the chicken. Thatâ€™s an herb? I donâ€™t like it because it reminds me of a girl I once knew. She threw rocks at me one day when I was walking home from school and I never forgot it. Heck with her."

What does that mean? â€œItâ€™s good with creamed onionsâ€ù I donâ€™t like creamed onions. In fact, I donâ€™t like French cooking and I feel better having said that. I think the French believe they invented food. â€œThyme was the symbol of courage in ancient Greece.â€ù Now I remember why Iâ€™m not a chef.\n\nCelery Salt\nVery salty and tastes like celery. I like both so I guess itâ€™s OK. The Indians may have used it to help tan skins.\n\nWhole Nutmegs\nThey look like small pecans before you take the hulls off. Not much smell. Youâ€™re supposed to grate them on top of hot chocolate and things like that. I may try it later tonight. It will impress my wife if she doesnâ€™t look closely at her kitchen table top.\n\nBay Leaves\nThese smell good. They look like plain old leaves to me, are about 3â€ù long and crisp to the bite. They are hand gathered from bay laurel trees and â€œcarefully dried to insure superior quality.â€ù I wonder why they have to be careful, theyâ€™re just leaves. Youâ€™re supposed to cook them in soups and other things but remove them before you serve the dish. I would sure hope so. They must grow near water.\n"

It is interesting also, that crazies continue to surface. I have emails from both police and doctors suggesting that I stay alert.

I enjoyed selecting what relics to include, and will admit to having sneaked in a few pieces from my personal medicine bundle. Some passions might derive a judicious sense of power from these ancient treasures. For me, itâ€™s the mystery associated with whose hands made them, and exactly when and where. And more importantly, what depth of relevance attached them to their creators. When used properly, imagination also can be a treasure. Sometimes I have deep feelings about olden things, especially when they reek with the history of how the world used to be.  With the simple drawing of a raffle ticket these artifacts will pass to a new custodian, and in time others will inherit what influence comes with their ownership. I am happy to let this bronze jar go in deference to this special cause, and with its transfer I will ask only that it be treated with the same respect and loving care with which it was formed. If kept intact it will endure a million years, and then ten-million more. ff"

The weather departing Santa Fe was terrible and for the first 100 miles I kept my eyes closed, deferring to Shiloh to keep me alive. How can you fly under clouds that are kissing the ground? I didnâ€™t want to know.\n\nSuzanneâ€™s house doesnâ€™t have an address so we received email directions and pulled up to a huge green gate, and rang the bell. After convincing the security staff we were not terrorists the gate opened and we drove a few narrow winding blocks to a secluded parking area surrounded by 10â€™ high oleanders and palo verde trees. It was like a jungle.\n\nStrangely, there are no roads within 300? of the house, (all of the building materials were carried up by burros). So the â€œwalkersâ€ù put us in a small open-air tram and pushed a button. Two minutes later we were half way up the side of a rocky mountain thatâ€™s full of mountain sheep, bob cats and rattle snakes. Suzanne doesnâ€™t like rattlesnakes.\n\nOur greeters at the top were George Hamilton, (He made 57 movies) and a lady with an unforgettable face who lived with Elvis for seven years. (Sorry, I forgot her name) George wanted to know about the hidden treasure and couldnâ€™t stop asking questions about it. Shiloh was impressed and I tried to appear indifferent."

He said that if he could get out of a contract he would go looking for it.\n\nA ten-piece orchestra played Cuban music non-stop in a natural stone amphitheater that abutted the house.

He denied it but Leslie told me.\n\nAt breakfast the next morning eight of us sat around Suzanneâ€™s kitchen table while her husband, Alan Hamel, cooked eggs over-easy on corn pone cakes and grits that were decorated with bitelets of bacon. Suzanne served healthy glasses of a severely green liquescent she described and â€œa blend.â€ù It was made of eight different fruits whose names were foreign to me, except bananas, and I didnâ€™t taste them in the mix. I drank it like it was good and Iâ€™m sure it was because Suz is a health nut.\n\nI didnâ€™t know the man sitting on my right but when he was introduced as Arnold Kopelson, I said â€œOh,â€ù pretending to understand.

I smiled and sat up straighter in my chair.\n\nAt 10:30 Shiloh and I jumped in the Cessna and pointed it 060 degrees for Santa Fe. The strong headwind didnâ€™t help so we stopped at Sedona for fuel and a buffalo burger with grilled onions and a small fries.

It was breathtaking, and I feel fortunate to have been able to take a trip like that.\n\nOn the way there, a funny thing happened every time I went through security at the airports, and when boarding the ship. Each time I sent my black Colorado Rockies backpack through the xray â€œtunnelâ€ù, the security agents would pull me aside and carefully go through the contents of my bag.  Aside from the tangle of headphones, kids books and snacks, I couldnâ€™t think of what could be in the bag that would be causing such a commotion.  Eventually, the TSA agents would look at me, then back into the bag, back at me again, and finally they would hand me the bag and send me on my way.  Of course I would rummage through the pack each time, trying to find what had caught their attention and could find nothing! I was perplexed at what could be causing such a commotion, but got busy with everything else and forgot about it for the whole week, while we enjoyed our cruise.\n\nA week later, while sadly packing up to head home, I discovered the culprit! In the very bottom of the backpack, hidden in the darkness, was a little memento I had kept from my first trip looking for your treasure chest.  It was an old rusty railroad spike, about 6 â€ù in length.  Iâ€™m sure you know the kind.\n\nI felt a little bad taking it at the time, but there had been many more lying around, so I didnâ€™t think this one would be missed.  It had followed me on all 3 trips to the same exact spot I was shooting for, where I believed that the chest was hidden.  I had to smile as I held the heavy little piece of iron in my hand, rolling it around.  I really had thought I was right, on that last trip to my â€œspotâ€ù.  Couldâ€™ve bet my life on it!  But I had to have been wrong, because I know you would have never hidden the chest on private property, right under the nose of a nice rancher who was unwittingly keeping guard over it.  So I decided the moment that I drove away that I must have been wrong after all â€“ as amazing as a solution I had to your puzzle, I had failed.\n\nAnd so I had given up on the chase and decided to move on.  That reminds me â€“ I always wondered why you called it the thrill of the â€œchaseâ€ù and not the â€œraceâ€ù.  A race implies an actual end point, and chase.. well not so much.\n\nAnyway, back to the railroad spike.  So Iâ€™m standing there holding this spike, wondering what to do with it.  My chase was over, and I didnâ€™t feel like being stopped by security every time on the way back, so the solution was clear.  I stepped out on the balcony as the ship passed quietly through the waters, and took a deep breath of the warm, salty air.  Then, doing my best Peyton Manning impression, I threw the spike as far as I could into the sea.  It slipped beneath the waves without a sound, and that was it.  And that, Mr. Fenn is where my quest ended- not on some dusty railroad track in New Mexico, but in the Eastern Caribbean.  The rusty spike is now sitting at the bottom of the ocean, thousands of miles away. I canâ€™t help but wonder if maybe thousands of years from now, some diver will discover it.  Can you imagine his (or her) surprise?  What the hell is this doing here, he would surely ask!  But more than likely, no one will ever find it. It will sit there at the bottom of the ocean for eternity.  And the only ones that knew it was there at all will be long gone.\n\nSo thatâ€™s my little story, and I hope I didnâ€™t take up to much of your time.  I really loved the chase â€“ it was truly a high point of my life.  I do feel that what you did was a good thing, getting people out there and spending time with their families.  Thank you again for that.  And if someone does find the chest â€“ where I thought it was â€“ then at least I will have the satisfaction of knowing I was right.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike B","Michael,\nThat is such a great story, and somewhat unusual. It was for people like you that I wrote the book and hid the treasure.\nForrest Fenn"

One of the first things she said to me after her diagnosis was that she wonâ€™t be able to search for your treasure this summer.  Sheâ€™s afraid that she will be in no shape to do any serious hiking and is bummed out about the whole situation.

My wife says theyâ€™re weeds, and I donâ€™t understand why. Who gets to decide whatâ€™s a weed and whatâ€™s a flower? Some things that seem simple to me can be so complicated for others. I think we should take another look at our definitions. If itâ€™s pretty, why would anyone call it a weed? Thatâ€™s a derogatory term. Besides, weeds grow much faster than flowers and thatâ€™s a plus for us gardeners. I wonder if our nursery sells weed seeds.\n\nAs with some definitions, there are many issues in this life that I donâ€™t agree with (â€œwithâ€ù is a preposition). Who made the rule that says I shouldnâ€™t end a sentence with a preposition? Probably some Harvard PhD somewhere. Einstein said, â€œEnding a sentence with a preposition is something up with which I will not put.â€ù He had a very unique way of saying things differently.

A short time later, Michael Douglas wandered into our gallery. I had not met him before but I knew his resume was crammed with accomplishments that would impress even the most self-possessed. He stayed in our guest house and we socialized for a short time. He seemed like a down-to-earth, normal kind of guy, so I asked him how he could not be affected by his successes, which included winning an Academy Award. His response spoke to his humanity. â€œBecause, as Kirk Douglassâ€™ son, I grew up with all those Hollywood stars who were big shots.â€ù\n\nMichael enjoyed antiques and purchased five of our African statues. They were large, gangly and hard to ship so I decided to pack them in my airplane and personally deliver them to his front door.\nA week later the two of us were chewing some finger cheeses and drinking wine beside his pool up Benedict Canyon, or wherever it was.

They werenâ€™t funny but thatâ€™s what they were called. Later they were renamed comic books but I will never subscribe to that unfortunate change.\n\nAcross the street from my house and down on the corner of French and Main was a magazine distributor. I forgot his name. Many of the publishers sent their periodicals to him and heâ€™d deliver them around town to every newsstand where magazines were sold. It was a small mom and pop operation.\n\nAt the end of each month all of the unsold magazines would have their covers removed and returned to the respective publishers for credit. The employee who made that happen was an elderly black man named Joe. I absolutely loved that old man, and after school Iâ€™d often go over to see him and weâ€™d talk about all sorts of things while I helped him tear covers. His grandparents had been slaves and his tales of picking cotton on the Mississippi river bottoms were right out of Mark Twain. When I told him Iâ€™d like to have worked alongside him in the fields. He said, â€œHush boy, you froth too much,â€ù or words to that effect. Funny that I would remember that about him.\n\nJoe, whose life experiences extended past both extremes, lived alone in one room that had an unshaded light bulb hanging from the ceiling. His space was so small that he sat on his bed while he worked. Joe was fluent about life on the foggy shores of civilization and I was thirsty to learn what he knew.\n\nHe told of being in a store in Hillsboro, Texas when it was robbed by Bonnie and Clyde. As the gangsters fled, a piece of paper fell from Bonnieâ€™s coat pocket. On it was a poem she had written. Joe pulled the poem from his bible and let me read it.\n\nI never heard Joe complain and maybe it was because he knew how to make things work. As a kid he greased wagon wheels, and for a while he walked door to door in town trying to sell turkeys. When he was successful heâ€™d go buy one from a farmer on credit and deliver it to his client for a small profit. Then heâ€™d walk a few miles back to pay the farmer.\n\nOccasionally I could beg Joe into letting me go home with a couple funny books that had their covers removed. I didnâ€™t care about that. The retail price was a dime and I couldnâ€™t afford even one. He had to take all unsold magazines to the dump and would get in trouble if he couldnâ€™t account for all of what he called â€œdead ends.â€ù Iâ€™d read them at night and take them back to Joe the next morning before school. I had many funny book heroes but my favorites were Sub-Mariner and Captain America.\n\nOccasionally my mom would make a mincemeat pie for me to take hot to Joe. They were his favorite, and once a month or so sheâ€™d invite him over for supper. I donâ€™t remember what happened to Joe because my mind has mostly faded into the rest of my life, but he was much more than just an asterisk in the family scrapbook of those years.

There was Edard, Kacir, Scotty, Paul Emery, Laurens, and several others who sat on the close periphery of our small group. They were all good guys and we were close, which made it even harder for me because I didnâ€™t jump off of the bridge. I was going to until I looked down and heard someone say that submerged logs sometimes lurked just under the surface and if you landed on one it would break both of your legs.\n\nâ€œLetâ€™s go,â€ù they yelled, and all of them jumped, leaving me standing all alone on the asphalt. I couldnâ€™t believe it. All of a sudden they were just gone and I wasnâ€™t. How do you think that made a 16 year-old, 138 pound kid feel?\n\nI knew what they were thinking â€œIt was a test for toughness and Fennâ€™s tail fell out.â€ù I could just see them telling every good looking girl in the whole junior class. It was a catastrophic moment for me and I felt terrible. My value shouldnâ€™t be diminished just because those guys couldnâ€™t see my real worth, should it?\n\nIt prayed on me, but for only a week or so. I felt my courage was only an inch too short to be long enough so I developed a plan that was indelible on my mind. Iâ€™d show those guys.\n\nOn a cold, moonless night about 3:00, I stole out of my bedroom window, jumped in the Bullet, and drove out highway 53. My mind was made up and nothing could stop me. No one was around so I stopped on the bridge and looked down. I couldnâ€™t see the water but I knew it was down there somewhere. My pulse was tingling but without a seconds hesitation I climbed over the rail with all of my clothes on and jumped. I just did it and that was that. After what seemed like an hour I hit the water with a hard, cold splash.\n\nWhen I surfaced my whole world had changed. I started laughing with an insane sense of empowerment. I really showed those guys, and ha, I did it at night. â€œJust waitâ€™ll the news gets out,â€ù I thought.\n\nI was wet and frozen when I climbed in my bedroom window. Another idea came to me. Why should I even tell anyone? They probably wouldnâ€™t believe me anyway.

George was blasted end-over-end out into the ocean where he flailed around in burning oil and gasoline for hours until he was rescued and put aboard the USS Hovey, another destroyer.\n\nIn less than 24-hours that ship was torpedoed and sank while George watched again from the vantage point of an ocean burning all around him. He didnâ€™t much care for the turn his life had suddenly taken.\n\nAfter the Navy, George settled in Cody where he became a professional outbacker and hunting guide. And he was painting some pretty good Indian pictures. When we met, about 1967, I was teaching pilot training in the Air Force but had orders to Vietnam. His parting words to me were, â€œIf you come back whole Iâ€™ll take you out where we can pick up some buffalo caps and maybe a skull or two.â€ù We both were collecting western history things. That invitation may have motivated me to fly faster and keep my head down deeper.\n\nUpon my return I gave George a hunk wax and asked him to create some figures for me to cast in bronze. Iâ€™d set up a foundry in my garage. He did that and so did I. Our relationship flourished into close personal and professional bonds.\n\nAnd of course he took me out into the Skylight country north of Cody where we found several dozen buffalo horn caps and a few skulls. This is my best one. It was a young bull. I found in some shades of a giant lodge pole pine.

Wish now I hadnâ€™t.\n\nAnd a basalt arrowhead was imbedded in the bone just inside his left eye. It penetrated only half an inch and broke where it was affixed to the arrow shaft. It didnâ€™t kill the animal and the bone grew back around, holding it tight.

He placed it on my head beside a campfire one night, and said, â€œFits you like a glass fits water, so I want you to have it.â€ù\n\nGeorge died last year at age 91, and his passage went largely unnoticed, save for a scant few guys like me and some relatives. But the coyotes and sage brush know heâ€™s gone, and so do the tall pines, under which he sat and drank coffee from a tin cup. The red embers of his camp fires will miss him badly, but not as much as me."

It advertised â€œShelling Corn,â€ù a large oil painting by Joseph Henry Sharp. It depicts Elkfoot Jerry Maribal and Crucita, two Taos Indians sitting on a banco by the fireplace in the artistâ€™s studio.\n\nThe ad conjured up old memories from my seventeen-years as a gallery owner in Santa Fe. I can recall the entire history of that shelling corn painting. Well, maybe not the entire history, but Iâ€™ll tell you what I know.\n\nIt was painted about 1925-35, Iâ€™d guess, but it could be a little earlier. I gave a local family $55,000 for it. They obtained it from the artist in trade for Navajo weavings. I sold the painting for $65,000 to an old friend. When he wanted to buy a yacht his wife made him sell the painting back to me for $75,000. Later, we sold it to a good client in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania for $150,000. When he passed away the director of the Los Angeles Athletic Club acquired it for $250,000 and sold it for $750,000. It sold again for 1.5 million and then again for I donâ€™t know what. Not bad appreciation for just 20 years or so.\n\nI interviewed Jerry Maribal in 1980 while researching my Sharp biography. Jerry was 110-years old, and totally blind. When I entered the room Jerry was reclining on his bed. He smiled and said, â€œIâ€™m happy to see you Mr. Fenn.â€ù\n\nMeeting Elkfoot Jerry Maribal was a wonderful life experience for me. He said interesting things about his early life at Taos pueblo and about his relationship with Mr. Sharp. In his quiet way he spoke through the haze of far-away memories while I mostly listened, not wanting to interrupt him with the weakness of my own thoughts. As I left his room a granddaughter said, â€œThe leaves will soon fall from the apricot tree.â€ù I thought that was such a beautiful Indian-thing to say. Mr. Maribal died the next morning, and out of respect, the pueblo was closed to all outsiders for three days."
4427,8/24/14,http://dalneitzel.com/2014/08/24/mummy_cave/,N/A - Consolidated quotes appearing throughout the article.,"Only a few minutes after you leave the East Entrance of Yellowstone, on the way to Cody, if you pay attention, youâ€™ll see a big cave there on the left. Its mouth is 150-feet wide and looks like a giant opera singer yawning in the side of the mountain. The beautiful North Fork of the Shoshoni River splashes the opposite side of the road right there. \n\nThe cave didnâ€™t have a name when I first knew it but it always made a strong impression on me, and it was a favorite lunchtime respite for my family when we were headed to Texas after a summer in Yellowstone.\n\nAnd of course I usually climbed into the cave and sat on a rock in the back to eat Fritos and drink my Dr. Pepper. That was in the 1930s and 40s.\n\nTwenty-five years later I became friends with two of the men who excavated the cave. They were Bobby Edgar and George Dabich. For two years in the middle 60s they carefully moved rocks, shoveled dirt, screened for artifacts, compiled data, and helped uncover Mummy Joe.\n\nAnd the cave finally had a name. The archaeological dig underway in the mid 60s.\n\nOnce, when George and I were having dinner at the Erma in Cody, he spoke of watching an archaeologist uncover an Angostura point that was 28-feet below the caveâ€™s surface. The weapon had been flaked to kill an ancient species of bison and had not seen daylight for almost 9,000 years.\n\nGeorge also talked about the artifacts he uncovered: stone choppers, hammers and grinders, projectile points, cordage, fragments of tanned sheepskin, arrow shafts, basketry, rabbit nets, and more than 2,000 leftover animal bones that had been discarded by the ancient dwellers.\n\nIn 1967 I received a gift from George. It was a 5-inch long knife heâ€™d carved from a mountain sheep bone that came from layer #3. He said it carbon-14 dated to about 682 AD.\n\nGeorgeâ€™s tales were colorful and compelling. He spoke of what it was like living in the cave 1200 years ago when Mummy Joe died, and of the trail weary hunters who returned from a hunt dragging elk hides full of meat that would sustain their clans through the freezing-cold winters. I was fascinated by the stories.\n\nAfter midnight, with Georgeâ€™s words fresh on my mind, I drove to Mummy Cave. The night was so black that the snow-covered ground offered little moderation. With a small light as my only companion I climbed up and in, and sat on my rock against the back wall. In the lonely silence nothing was moving but the wind that whispered its way through the trees, down the river, and past the cave.\n\nAs I sat in the eerie quietness I could feel the austere grandeur of my surroundings. Who were these ancient people who called this sheltered place home? Over the last few thousand years several hundred nature-toughened Indians had rested their butts on the very rock upon which I sat. I just knew it. Can you imagine how that made me feel?\n\nToday my thoughts sometimes harken back to Mummy Joe, who was wrapped in sheepskins so long ago, and buried deep in the dirt. What would I have thought when I was a kid, sitting on my rock, knowing that Joe was just a few feet away. Are there any among you who are as intrigued by Americaâ€™s ancient past as I am? Tell me."

The action was heating up and when the Tet Offensive started twelve days later I had already flown fifteen combat missions in the F-100.\n\nTet was the big push by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Regulars to take over South Vietnam and push America and her allies into the beautiful South China Sea. The last attack in that offensive was on February 10th. During the intervening eleven days 14,000 Vietnamese civilians were killed and 24,000 were wounded. I have maintained my sanity over the ensuing years by telling myself that none of them were in my target areas.\n\nAt 0300 on the morning of 31 January, Tuy Hoa, where I was stationed, was hit hard. I was jolted awake by the sound of explosions and machine gun fire. I didnâ€™t know what to do. We werenâ€™t allowed to have fighting weapons in our living areas, so I climbed on top of my hootch where I could hide and watch the action.\n\nEnemy sappers breeched the base perimeter and threw satchel charges under our airplanes. Wings and tails were blown high into the black sky. The light from huge fires allowed our security forces to see enemy troops running around. Most intruders were killed but many disappeared back into the night.\n\nAbout 0900 the fighting was over and we started taking inventory. The warm-eyed Vietnamese woman who did my laundry; a pleasant person whom I liked and gave soap to, was killed coming through the concertina wire. She was a Viet Cong soldier. Identifying her body was almost beyond the reach of my imagination.\n\nIt was a frightening scene at our Command Post, with AK-47s, hand grenades and rocket launchers littering the sand all around. I retrieved a small flag from the body of a Viet Cong soldier who didnâ€™t make it through the razor wire. Our intelligence officer said the flag was one that had been hand-stitched in silk by a local Vietnamese family who was selling them as souvenirs to the GIs. The flags werenâ€™t official, or issued, and had nothing to do with the war. All of that changed when the Viet Cong raided the small shop, killed the family, and took their inventory of flags.\n\nSo now, forty-six years after leaving the Vietnam War, I have successfully unremembered many details of my involvement. But I still wonder if my small 32-inch flag is a legitimate trophy from that conflict, or just the peaceful symbol of an unfortunate family that was caught in the middle, trying to make a living. What do you think?"

Hereâ€™s the result.\n\nLater, Noah asked about that strange looking dog that was prancing around the yard with such artistry? No one dared speak under penalty of death.

His small clan of wanderers stood anxiously by as a group of giant mammoths grazed in the distant view.\n\nWhen the point was completed, and hafted, Hothgar stalked a calf that had strayed from the herd and with a mighty throw, his Clovis spear point penetrated the 2,000 pound body of his prey.\n\nThe hunter quickly retreated to the safety of a nearby cottonwood knot and waited. As the herd ambled on, Hothgar and his tribe followed, for perhaps a week or more, until the young animal succumbed to its wound. At last the nomadic family ate. And after a few weeks Hothgar again sat on a log and began to knap."

Wine bottle stoppers were good. My father taught me how to make those things, but Iâ€™ll admit to not having made one in over 60 years.\n\nFirst, Iâ€™d take a big Eagle Claw hook and clamp it in the vise. Then Iâ€™d tie the tail on, which took some imagination. Every popper was different, and sometimes Iâ€™d tie on grizzly saddle hackles, javelina bristles, squirrel fur, or hair from the rear end of my neighborâ€™s cat. Once I found a bald-headed ladyâ€™s brunette wig at the dump. It made good popper tail material.\n\nThen Iâ€™d shape the cork to look like something a big fish wanted to eat, and bind it to the hook shank. Bass are carnivorous animals so the juicier the bait looks, the more likely they are to attack it. They especially like frogs.\n\nThe fun part came next, and that was painting the lure. I used some of my sisterâ€™s fingernail polish and that added to the excitement for me.  Ha, she never found out, and a salvo of discouragements wouldâ€™ve blistered my ears if sheâ€™d known. Oh, please forget I said that last part.\n\nI put lots of eyes on my poppers to make them look threatening. Bass will usually attack when they feel frightened. That twist of knowlege always gave me an edge.\n\nThe fact is I never fished with any of my hand-painted poppers, and thatâ€™s the truth. There was no way a slippery sided smallmouth black bass was going to scratch the paint on my special, sculptural artforms. Thatâ€™d be tantamount to messing with my poem. f"

Thatâ€™s what we did, and we were many miles from a road on a friendâ€™s ranch in northeastern New Mexico. We first found a large mammoth tooth. The enamel plates had broken apart and the wear patterns said it belonged to a very old animal.\n\nA mile or so farther, as we walked along a softly flowing stream of water, I discovered a tusk. It had been exposed to the elements for a long time because the ivory had dried and layers were popping off in fragments. I guessed it was a mammoth because mastodons are not commonly found in the Southwest.\n\nI started excavating in the cement-like clay that engulfed the tusk. It was a hot summer day, and the bursitis-inducing work with a small handpick progressed slowly.\n\nMeanwhile my ranch friend scavenged the surrounding area, searching for artifacts. Suddenly he discovered a knife eroding from the bank. It was of useful size and made of Edwards Plateau flint. Heavy damage on both blade edges indicated that it may have been used to cut meat from bone. We knew that tool could not be associated with the mammoth because the flake patterns were not Clovis technology, and Clovis man was the only human known to kill the great beasts.\n\nI continued working as the sun burned low in the sky. Finally the tusk was completely uncovered and I took this photo.\n\nMy efforts to learn when the mammoth died proved futile because there wasnâ€™t enough collagen in the ivory to obtain a carbon-14 date. That meant the animal died many years ago â€“ perhaps 50,000 or more.\n\nThe mammoth tusk weighed 70 pounds when we lifted it into the bed of the pickup. Over the years it has dried and crumbled into a sad semblance of what it used to be.\n\nFor those who read Dalâ€™s blog and want a rare ivory fragment of American history, please send a padded, self-addressed stamped envelope, postmarked on January 5, 2015, or earlier, to:\n\nForrest Fenn\nP.O. Box 8174\nSanta Fe, NM  87504.\n\nIf one should grasp a chunk of an ancient mammoth in oneâ€™s hand and close oneâ€™s eyes, who knows what thoughts might flow into oneâ€™s fertile mind?\n\nI always intended to go back to my friendâ€™s ranch and dig out the mammoth skull. But itâ€™s been thirty years since I walked along that softly flowing stream of water, and now, at age 84 â€_  itâ€™s just too much for me."

It was few miles north and west of where, in 1959, a mountain fell and dammed the Madison River that formed Quake Lake.\n\nTo reach Avalanche Lake I had to climb about 3,000 feet, over a six mile stretch. In one spot the path was only 4 feet wide and had a 700-foot tumbledown drop on the left. It was a scary place and if my hat blew off Iâ€™d never see that thing again. The Forest Service said no one ever went up there because the hike was too tough.\n\nMy father warned that grizzlies ranged in the area where I was going so I planned to carry a dead fish. If I met a bear Iâ€™d throw the fish at him and run downhill. A grizzlyâ€™s front legs are shorter than its hind legs so I would have the advantage if it came to a race. Besides, my incentive would be greater than his.\n\nAfter seven hours I reached the lake and started fishing. The water was deep and cold. Several dozen huge golden trout slowly swished through the glassy water. To my disappointment, none of them wanted any fly in my vast repertoire of lures, not even a wooly worm.\n\nOne of my most humbling dreads, and one thatâ€™s most idiosyncratic of my personality, is to be ignored by a beautiful fish. I didnâ€™t catch any â€_ not even one to throw at a griz if I met him on the down trail.\n\nThe next day, while preparing to leave, I placed my Dr. Pepper under a rock in the lake to save for next time. No need to haul it out. ZOWEE!!! Thatâ€™s when I noticed the fresh water shrimp. It looked like a hundred of them scurrying about. They were small, maybe 1/4th inch long, and their yellowish-translucent color made them almost invisible. That had to be the answer. Thatâ€™s what the fish were feeding on. I could hardly wait get home and make some flies that imitated the shrimp.\n\nSeveral weeks later I took Donnie with me to the lake. I wanted to apply my fishing genius and show those rude trout who was their better.\n \nLast Lament\n\nOh, somewhere near a placid mountain meadow\nA mariposa lily blooms its yellow best.\nAnd on the hills and in the valleys mellow,\nThe chirpy plover gathers grasses for her nest.\n\nBut on a lake that tries the sportsmanâ€™s skill,\nHe went to cast his line and catch a trout,\nAlone he stood to test the wily fishes will.\nAnd again the mighty fisherman struck out."

They were farmers who subsisted on corn, squash, and whatever else they could find growing in the high pinon & juniper desert.\n\nMuch of the pottery they produced was decorated with abstract bird motifs applied with a glaze paint called galena (lead ore). Rarely is any other kind of animal in evidence.\n\nA hundred years later life was very different. The Indians had moved 1,000 feet east across Del Charro Creek where they built two and three story dwellings that were made from slabs of latite, an igneous rock.\n \nAnd still, bird designs were the favored art forms. It is common to excavate long bones from the buffalo, antelope, horse, cow, and other domesticated animals that were brought in by the Spaniards. The bones are found in the trash heaps, in the plaza, and in the rooms. But we donâ€™t see those animals on the pottery. Why is that?\n\nThere must be an overpowering reason because itâ€™s too extraordinary to be coincidental.

So when I got out of bed on the morning of the 7th, my wife asked, â€œWhere are you going?â€ù The question was a shock and I suddenly realized that I didnâ€™t have any place to go. So I got back under the covers and started pondering the future of my family.\n\nMy retirement pay was 800 bucks a month, and I had a wife and two young daughters to support. Necessity wets the wits of the inexperienced and that meant I had to move quickly.\n\nMy hobby was casting art bronze. I did it by running a natural gas line from the fireplace in our living room, through the kitchen and pantry, and into our garage. Thatâ€™s where I melted and poured the metal. I was a one-person operation. Could I turn it into a living, I wondered?\n\nMy foundry equipment was homemade. I powered the melting furnace with a vacuum cleaner motor, and, by welding in my front yard, I created the lifting tongs and the pouring shanks.\n\nMy wife and I decided to go for it and see what would happen. She would tend the house and the kids, and I would finance the operation.\n\nSo I hired two guys and rented an old, abandoned grain elevator in town. My idea had little to offer but some promise â€_ and a whole lot of exertion.\nSoon, I was casting work for artists who couldnâ€™t pay. They wanted to settle up when they sold their bronzes that they couldnâ€™t sell. That twist started me thinking. I could make the castings at very little cost if I didnâ€™t count my labor. So I started buying the artistsâ€™ original wax models and casting editions for myself.\n\nThat should have solved the problem, but I quickly realized that I couldnâ€™t sell the bronzes either. So I learned to trade. It was easy to make deals with traders who had antique guns and Indian things that they couldnâ€™t sell. After months of working all day long and most of the night, I still didnâ€™t have any money. But I had a nice inventory of Indian baskets, rugs, Winchester rifles, and Colt pistols. I was like the rich man who had all of his money in a safe and couldnâ€™t find the key.\n\nMy wife and I lived that life for two years until we moved to Santa Fe where we slept on the floor and built a foundry â€“ and an art gallery. Peggy was my rock and mortar.\n\nLots of doubts and insecurities were felt during those building years. We learned early on to stop looking for reasons why something couldnâ€™t be done, and to just go do it! And I have never been sorry."

He could sense my excitement as I explained the merits of possessing two of Godâ€™s most magnificent creatures. â€œThey live close to the earth,â€ù I said, â€œAnd besides, theyâ€™ll reduce the rattlesnake population on your property, thus enhancing its value.â€ù The enthusiasm in my voice won the day. and my precious pets quickly became his very own.\n\nSeveral months later I drove out to see how the pesky hogs were faring. As I neared the south pasture I noticed the ranch foreman sitting high up in a pinon tree with two severely predatory boars below, looking up with hungry anticipation.\n\nSo I thought it was judicious to quietly turn my Jeep around and head back into the direction from whence I had come.

One purchased a fuse bomb, lit it, and tossed it over the counter at Leroy, thinking it would be a fun joke. Except that the dangerous apparatus landed on some Areal Bombettes, which promptly detonated with a furious ricocheting blast that was heard clear down to the cemetery, two miles distant.

It came from the Jungle Cock, which was a fowl indigenous to India.\n\nFlies made from its feathers were popular among trout fishermen in the 40s, but not so much anymore. The â€œeyes,â€ù as we called them, were always tied on the hook in pairs, one on each side.\n\nThere was a time when the bird was classified â€œEndangered,â€ù which meant no one in America could legally buy, sell, barter, or import the feathers. They became so scarce that a frightened stillness fell over the entire fly-tying community. Fishermen spoke in hushed whispers about the law that seemed unreasonably punitive. But the war was going on and there were other big issues to think about.\n\nI caught a nice brown with this fly, and you can see how it got chewed up. I retired it to a place of honor in my ornament box. I used a lot of peacock herl on my streamers, but never made two the same. The fish didnâ€™t care, because they were so hedonistic in those days theyâ€™d eat anything that looked like a bug, and Jungle Cock eyes made them all the more ferocious.\n\nMy special fly box still contains about 200 Jungle Cock flies that I made as a teenager. They were so handsome I retired them also. No malodorous fish was going to chew those beautiful bugs.\n\nIf anyone can make a better looking fly than this one, and post its photo on Dalâ€™s blog, Iâ€™ll give them a quarter. Just send me a SASE,\n\nEach fly my father sold was impaled upon one of these little advertisements."

Our job was repairing airborne radars and flying radio operator on C-82s and C-119s.\n\nSammy and I enjoyed a friendly competition with each other on a personal level. Compared to him, I was shorter, less obvious, and more talently disadvantaged. But I had the instincts of an adventurer, and he didnâ€™t. Maybe that gave me a slight edge in areas where results could easily be measured.\n\nOne such place was The Tower. (I hated that thing with a dedicated cynical fervor.) I donâ€™t even want to remember how high off the water it was, but it was enough high for me. I had jumped off the Leon River Bridge at home a few times so I knew how long the fall time was â€“ it was forever, or at least that thought came to me.\n\nSammy and I dove off the intermediate level a few times, and jumped off the top a couple. Then he made a nice swan dive from high up that barely broke the surface of the water. I figured he was warming up to do a dive that I didnâ€™t even want to think about. He appeared too nonchalant for my taste.\n\nâ€œDo a â€˜show off,â€™ and Iâ€™ll take your picture,â€ù Sam dared from ground. I just stared. The pressure began to build, and it was so terrible my mind went into spacial overload for a few seconds.\n\nWhile standing on the top, in the #1 position, my entire life flashed before my eyes. Did I dare? Iâ€™d done a few 1 Â_ forward somersaults from a ten foot springboard, but I didnâ€™t do them very well. Now it was put-up or shut-up time. My smile was a misnomer and I knew the desire in my heart was at odds with reality, but I was drawn to the seductive glamour of Samâ€™s camera.\n\nWith a deep breath and a giant spring, I left the platform in a tuck, which opened too late, and my dive quickly unraveled into an over-rotation that landed me flat on my back. Whatever confidence I had was knocked out of me with a sudden traumatic jolt. The blistering pain was almost visible and my embarrassment rang out in exaggerated decibels.\n\nâ€œGot it,â€ù Sam yelled, â€œThey heard the splash in Memphis! You almost made it, Buddy, try it again. I have one more shot on the roll.â€ù\n\nWith all I could muster, there I stood again in the rarefied #1 position. But this time I was mad â€_ mad that heâ€™d ask me to do it again after Iâ€™d just maimed myself, and mad because with his street level imagination, he thought I wouldnâ€™t try.\n\nIf Iâ€™d over-rotated trying to do a 1 Â_, what if I stayed in the tuck a little longer and went for a 2 Â_. Ha, Iâ€™d never even thought of that before, but what a great idea. To forget my previous mistake would be done at my own peril. That was for sure.\n\nWith the thought that talent has no loyalty, I left the platform in a tighter tuck than before, thinking that I wanted to see the sky twice as I rotated, then quickly open and enter the water.\n\nAnd to my great surprise and satisfaction, thatâ€™s exactly what happened. The dive was not very pretty, but it was there, and both my body and tattered ego were intact. Sam got the picture, and congratulated me with a pleasant sincerity that felt really good. I never climbed the ladder on that tower again, and I still havenâ€™t."

Thatâ€™s if she has any, flaws I mean.\n\nEricâ€™s depiction of an airplane flying above the clouds on the front of my bronze is a take-off of his 59 x 75 foot mural thatâ€™s on the wall of the National Air and Space Museum in the Smithsonian. Lindberghâ€™s famous airplane, the Spirit of St. Louis, hangs in front of the mural.\n\nEric said that I was flying the airplane in my little painting. His smiling words fell softly on my willing ears. Such was his friendship.\n\nGlenna captured that mischievous smile on Ericâ€™s face. I know it well. It meant he was about to say something entertaining, probably at my expense.\n\nHe was the most productive man I ever knew. He could paint a major painting a day, lunch with me, and dine out with his wife that night. And he wrote fifty books in fifty years, or close to it. I talked about that in his biography, Seventeen Dollars a Square Inch.\n\nGlenna also gave me a $1,000 bill. It was to commemorate ten years of being in the art business together.\n\nIf Iâ€™d put it in an interest bearing note when I received it, thirty-three years ago, at 6% interest compounded annually, itâ€™d now be worth â€_ oh, never mind.

It was not the deluxe model so it didnâ€™t have a sun visor or windshield wiper on the passenger side.\n\nIt was eleven years old when I purchased it in Atlanta, Georgia for $250. A thick book and a pillow were placed on the seat so I could see over the dash.\n\nI drove only at night so the police couldnâ€™t see I was only 15. The 1,200 miles to my home in Temple, Texas passed slowly at a top speed of 55 mph, but it was love at first sight for me. During the day I curled up on the back seat and dreamed about my beautiful Plymouth.\n\nIt had no safety glass in the windows, no air conditioner or radio, no power steering or power brakes, & no power windows or turn signals. I stuck my arm out when I wanted to turn; straight out meant left and straight up meant right. I felt like I was bragging every time I signaled a turn. But I could lever the windshield up when I wanted ventilation.\n\nPeggy named my wonderful car â€œThe Bulletâ€ù because she said it was shot. Out of respect, we never used that term when we were within earshot of the car.\n\nWhen we were in high school, in the late 40s, Iâ€™d take Peggy home for lunch, and thirty minutes later, pick her up again. We always had a few minutes to sit in the Bullet, listening to Eddy Arnold on the portable radio while waiting for the bell to ring. Gas was 11 cents and I often pulled into a station and bought two gallons for a quarter, and saved the three cents change for next time.\n\nWhen Peggy and I wanted to go out on a date, like for a burger and a movie at the Arcadia Theatre, Iâ€™d pawn my two-dollar bill with Peggyâ€™s mother.

I am trying to decide where to leave it when Iâ€™m gone. Canâ€™t be just anyplace.\n\nWhen I went to Yellowstone for the summer of 1950, Peggy drove the Bullet for three months.

When I mentioned it to my friend Richard Blake, who is a serious car nut and has 9 garages all in a row, he went to work. Richard is the worldâ€™s leading authority on the sun, and is a retired solar physicist from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nIt took some long months for Richard to find The Bulletâ€™s twin brother. It was in Maryland and he successfully talked the owner into selling. With one email I came out of mourning after sixty-five years. All of a sudden, instead of feeling old, I felt like Iâ€™d ripened.

He was very still â€“ just looking. Another landed beside him (or her), and a third, and then a fourth. They were perfectly aligned, as if in a pew. Where was my camera?\n\nIâ€™ve often wondered how insects of the same species recognize each other. \n\nThey canâ€™t see themselves so how do they know theyâ€™re chumming with others of the same kin? Yes, I know, itâ€™s instinct. But because they all look exactly alike how can one identify his brothers from the others?\nThen some damselflies arrived, both red and blue. They bobbed about for a while, but soon were gone with little more than casual disinterest. Maybe they had a beef. Perhaps they didnâ€™t like what their cousins were doing on the water iris leaf?\n\nA chair is posted at a favored spot beside the pond. My fishing rod is kept there too, constantly at the ready. A dragonfly likes to rest there also. He always looks so composed. Evidently blue dragonflies are not likewise so disposed.\n\nThen suddenly, amid a muffled whirr of sound, a resident hummingbird joined our company and checked me out, and the dragonfly too. She likes to dart back and forth, and hover.\n\nThis must be her nest. It was just there, lying on the ground. There were no eggs or shells anywhere around. Hmmm.\n\nThree esteemed inhabitants on the pond are Angelo, Barney, and Tail End Charlie, so named because of a birth defected left leg that slows him to half a normal waddling gait. How did such an imperfection occur, and when? A friend told me it was either a freak of nature, or something his mother ate. Okay then.\n\nThey were 3â€ù tall when I purchased them at the San Marcos Feed Store. The clerk said, â€œYou canâ€™t take just one; they come in sets,â€ù like he knew. I didnâ€™t think three bucks each was too much to pay for the cute little pets. Do you?\n\nSeveral times a day the farm ducks come up on the grass and quack, which means theyâ€™re ready for their cracked corn snack.\n\nThe hungry threesome likes to wander up and down a little streamlet that flows into the pond, looking for things to grub. Crawfish, being lower on the food chain, are mostly too late in hiding, as are some of the water bugs.\n\nBoth peppermint and spearmint plants grow in great abundance at the waterfall, blocking most of the splashing water from our view. The blossoms on top of the mint attract bees from all around the neighborhood.

Itâ€™s a static electricity phenomenon, she claimed. When that happens lightning is about to hit nearby with a jolt. But if I jump really high, maybe it will hit the ground while Iâ€™m still in the air, thus saving me from the fiery bolt.\n\nOf course I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s true. She also said you shouldnâ€™t plant a weeping willow tree because when it gets big enough to cover your grave, youâ€™ll die. However, Peggy and I have such a giant willow that we planted as a seedling in 1988, and weâ€™re still vertical. Makes me suspicious of grandmotherly wisdom.\n\nNothing but good can happen when Iâ€™m still and observing wildlife in its natural landscape. To describe it almost wears me out of words.

Itâ€™s a foggy question I know, but Iâ€™m thinking about a life-size print on canvas by Velasquez, Botticelli, or maybe Ilya Repin.\n\nDoes it seem reasonable to you that a $50,000,000 value should separate an original by one of those guys from a print of the same painting, when, from five feet away, they look exactly alike? And if the original and the reproduction were hanging side by side, and you didnâ€™t know, Iâ€™ll bet youâ€™d choose the one in the best frame.

These were the most special 10 days I can recall in all my youth. Though my mom, dad, brother and sister were there for the fishing, I have to admit I was there for the horses. I can still remember all 14 of them with names and color (how is that even possible). Our guide, Bob Adams (how do I remember that???), would get up before everyone else and catch trout for breakfast. There is nothing better to wake up to than trout for breakfast over the campfire! It was 10 glorious day in the wilderness with lots of fishing and wildlife watching!\n\nLooking for treasure clues online brought up all kinds of Yellowstone photos and reminded how I always said I would return. Somehow I never did. Donâ€™t know why. But now I am determined to take my trip down memory lane next summer before it is too far for me to walk! Thank you SO much for that extra push in the right direction!\n\nIn doing my research, I was looking for connections that might tell me why you used the phrase â€œif youâ€™ve been wiseâ€ù and found this lovely story about the Eagle family and their â€œright of passageâ€ù introducing the next generation to fishing the Firehole River. Subsequently I decided that there was no connection between â€œwiseâ€ù and â€œHoot Owl Holeâ€ù where the Eagle family started the younger kids fishing but it was a great story anyway. It led me to wonder if you were friends with the family as they did have an outfitting store in West Yellowstone and were themselves fishing guides in Yellowstone. Just curious.

They blamed me for it not being there for them. It is not easy to find but it certainly is not impossible. Early on a reporter asked me who my audience was for my book.

I have said many times that no one should extend themselves beyond their comfort zone, physically or financially...Yes, but in the same way gold miners, gamblers, hunters and baseball fans become addicted...When they go to retrieve, and it isn't there,they either claim someone has already found it or the whole story is a hoax.

There is so much going on in the world and they are distracted. My advice would be to set aside an hour each day to just think. Don't rule out any idea...There seemed to be despair everywhere. I wanted to give people some hope and something to believe in....They say money can't buy happiness but it can make a nice down payment. I have decided that having enough money is a lot better than having a lot of money... I wanted to give the kids something to do. They spend too much time in the game room or playing with their little hand held texting machines. I hope parents will take their children camping and hiking in the Rocky Mountains. I hope they will fish, look for fossils, turn rotten logs over to see what's under them, and look for my treasure... There are only a few who have said it is a hoax and I don't say anything to them. The funny part is that they think they know exactly where it is hidden. When they arrive at that spot and the treasure is not there, they think one of two things. Either someone has already found it or it's a hoax. Ironically, most of them are still looking."

When I said no, she asked me what I wanted. I told her I would like to have permission to fly the generalâ€™s F-86F. He was Chief of Flying Safety for the entire Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, and had no business letting a lowly 2nd Lt. fly his airplane, especially since I had never flown that model before. Thatâ€™s what I had going against me.  I had not met the general but knew him by reputation. Everyone did. He shot down three German airplanes in WW-2 and when his P-51 took battle damage, he was forced to bail out over the English Channel. He floated around in a one-man dinghy for two days, finally washing ashore in France. His hands and feet were frozen when the Germans took him prisoner. As the senior officer in Stalag Luft 1, he gave a speech that the German commander said was â€œriotous,â€ù and Spicer was sentenced to six months in solitary confinement and then execution by firing squad. The day before he was to be executed, his POW camp was overrun by Russian soldiers and the Germans fled. Spicer was liberated.  When the generalâ€™s secretary picked up the phone and said, â€œGeneral, I think you should come out here,â€ù most of my cockiness went south, and I suddenly felt like a crippled ant in an elephant parade.\n\nThe generalâ€™s huge, black mustache startled me because it separated his nose from his mouth in such a commanding way. I wondered if he could intake air. When he grinned at me, and after we saluted, he invited me into his office. â€œWhat can I do for you, Sir?â€ù the general asked as he lit his pipe and offered me a seat. I told him my name, and that I was a pilot in the 85th Fighter Interceptor Squadron flying the F-86D, and that one of our hangars was next to where he kept his plane. We talked for a while. I had seen him many times approach the field at 1,500â€™, 250 knots, make a tight pitchout, drop the gear and flaps, and land. To me it was like poetry. His F-86F was the same model that had shot down most of the Migs during the Korean War, and I really wanted to fly it\n\nHe looked at me for a few seconds, then picked up the phone. â€œGet my crew chief for me please.â€ù The general said, â€œPull my airplane out because Lt. Forrest Fenn is coming down to fly it.â€ù I was really grinning. I thanked him, saluted, and turned to leave when he said, â€œDonâ€™t you dare break my airplane.â€ù The crew chief stood on the ladder and talked me through the engine start. That must have been 1954, and I flew for about an hour. It was the thrill of my life to fly that airplane. I went back to my squadron thinking I was the worldâ€™s leading ace. When my boss learned what I had done, he came over and congratulated me, not because I had flown the generalâ€™s airplane, but because I had guts enough to ask him if I could.\nBut thatâ€™s not all of the story.\n\nFive years later I saw the general again. He was commander of the 17th Air Force at Wheelus Air Base, Libya, where we had a gunnery school. He remembered some brash Lt. asking to fly his plane, but he didnâ€™t remember my name.\n\nThirty years later, the lady who purchased my gallery hired one of General Spicerâ€™s sons to be her driver. Is this a small world, or what? f"

They were in their twenties or so, and Iâ€™m sure of that.\nPeople smiled at the sight of them walking around, holding hands, and\nmunching on the finger things we had near the wine cooler. In subsequent\nweeks I saw them infrequently around town, whispering to each other, and\nholding hands, a sure sign of impending problems.\n\nI donâ€™t remember her name, so for some subliminal reason probably, Iâ€™ll call\nher Angel. She was walking toward me one day as I departed the bank on\nPalace Avenue. Her eyes were red, her hair was a gnarling muddle, and she\nwas sobbing uncontrollably. I was startled.\n\nWhen we stopped to talk, and as she smeared a hankie across her face, she\nexplained what a bad person her ex-husband was and that she would never\nrecover from what he did to her. â€œItâ€™s been two months, you know.â€ù No, I\ndidnâ€™t know, but that was okay.\n\nAfter a long coffee respite at the Plaza Cafe, her emotions subsided\nsomewhat. I learned that Angel was a professional potter who was trying to\nsupport herself in a failing market. I felt terrible, and wondered what I\ncould do to help.\n\nFinally, it came to me. I told her to go make her divorce in the form of a\npot, â€œbecause weâ€™re going to have a funeral.â€ù She started laughing and\nhugged me, then laughed and hugged me some more. The spell of doom was\nbroken and she hurried away to her studio.\n\nWell, ten days later I was digging a hole at the north end of room block two\nat San Lazaro Pueblo. It was beside a pre-historic path that led down to the\nclay mine. Angel was sniffling into her hankie. It had been an awkward\nforty-five minute drive as I had tried desperately to concentrate on the\nroad.\n\nShe had made the ugliest pottery thing I have ever seen. It was about 18?\nhigh, 10? across, and it reeked with dismal black figures that had sharp\nedges. The iron nails that she had driven periodically around that poor jar\nhad been mostly destroyed and were crumbling as a result of the\nhigh-temperature firing. Angel had written her exâ€™s name in big black\nletters, but I am sure it was misspelled. â€œFerd,â€ù it said. I wondered what\nthat was all about.\n\nAfter she threw some things into the pot, I put the lid on, placed it\nreverently into the ground, and covered it up with dirt. Then she started\npiling rocks on the grave. She kept piling them on. I suppose maybe she was\nafraid that somehow her divorce would get out of the hole.\n\nLeaving her alone to conduct the funeral, I walked back to wait in the car.\n\nWell, Iâ€™ve never heard such carrying on. It was so loud! There was yelling\nand sobbing and singing, and screaming maledictions. She spit out a few\nwords, the definitions of which I was not cognizant. During one loud scream\nI heard the word â€œFred,â€ù and I think the blossoms started falling from a\nnearby cholla cactus. I quickly rolled my car windows up.  Twenty minutes later, we were driving home. Angel was giggling and her hair\nlooked nice. All of a sudden she rolled the window down, threw her hankie\nout, and looked at me. She just looked at me and smiled. Thatâ€™s all! Wow,\nonce in a while I do something really good. f"

Delores was her name and we were special friends. It didnâ€™t take her family long to add up their assets, and that gave me an idea.\n\nThe Senior Prom was coming up and I said if sheâ€™d make all C grades or better Iâ€™d give her a new dress for the ball. Her whole face grinned because she was worried sheâ€™d have to wear her big sisterâ€™s hand me down pants suit again. I guess itâ€™d been handed down a few times already.\n\nBut Delores was still young and didnâ€™t have many living experiences so I devised a plan that I hoped would help her grow some trail mojo like me. I started giving her gifts that were nothing good, like a feather one time, and a picture of Johnny Dukakis, and other things like that. And some different colored Wriglets of course. This went on for several weeks.\n\nSure enough, she finally came to me and said to not give her anything else. I had fed her up with junk and I secretly smiled. Ha, now to spring the trap. â€œLook,â€ù I said, if you donâ€™t want gifts from me anymore lets shake hands and make the deal final so it would be unethical for me to give you things again.â€ù She smiled and we shook.\n\nThen I said â€œDelores, I am proud of you for thinking things through and knowing what you want. You are such a wonderful person.

I just told her to let Delores figure something out and hung up the phone right then because I didnâ€™t want my cell battery to run down.\n\nWell, that very afternoon here came Delores sloshing through the mud and ringing my bell. She said, â€œMister Fenn I want to unshake our deal.â€ù â€œWhat,â€ù I muttered? She told me that if you can shake to seal a deal you should be able to unshake it away and she went on to explain. â€œIf you count a pigâ€™s tail as a leg how many legs would the pig have?â€ù I told her â€œfive, of course.â€ù She shined and said â€œNo, a pig has four legs. Just because you count the tail as a leg doesnâ€™t mean it is one,â€ù and she kind of snickered. I thought that was a good analogy so we high-fived three times with our left hand. That, she explained, is how you unshake a deal and I decided her mojo was ok after all.\n\nThe story had a wonderful ending and Iâ€™m a little proud of myself. The fifteen dollars, plus tax, that I paid for that beautiful dress was the best money I ever spent. f"

There must be incidents from those days that still stick in your mind. Can you share a few with us?~Thanks, Romnella","Sure Romnella, there are many.\n\nSometimes my memory harkens back to an incident that happened in 1950. I was a new private in the Air Force and was totally overwhelmed by high ranking sergeants. Officers didnâ€™t bother me because I rarely saw one.\n\nIn the mess hall one day I opened a new bottle of catsup. When I did, the rim broke in my hand and small fragments of glass fell in on top. I was justifiably appalled and quickly realized that my destiny was at hand. When I approached the Mess Sergeant the six stripes on his sleeve truly intimidated me, mostly because I didnâ€™t have any. And his many battle chevrons glared at me with impunity. I was also overawed by the knowledge that he was a survivor of the Bataan Death March.\n\nBut I was duty bound and focused on my mission. â€œLook Sergeant,â€ù I pronounced with malplaced authority, â€œThis catsup bottle is full of broken glass.â€ù His look told me I should have eaten it anyway.\n\nâ€œWell Private, what the hâ€” do you want me to do about it? Throw the dâ€” thing in the trash.â€ù I was slapped in the face by his words. I didnâ€™t think I deserved a medal necessarily, but it could be argued that my alertness and quick action had saved a few lives, and in wartime no less.\n\nEighteen years later I was a major in war ravaged Vietnam, when I observed a Master Sergeant dump a fifty-five gallon drum of expensive hydraulic fluid on the ground. When I asked what the hâ€” he was doing, he told me that he needed the barrel to make a BBQ pit for the troops.\n\nWell, I didnâ€™t know what the hâ€” to say. It was a war zone, and morale was important. I decided to shut up because I was just a Major and he was a Master Sergeant, and I wasnâ€™t completely sure who ranked whom. f"

5722,4/15/12,https://www.abqjournal.com/100209/footprint-of-wars-lessons-indelible.html,N/A - Consolidated quotes appearing throughout the article.,"During the war in Vietnam I was assigned to a fighter squadron whose mission was to kill as many Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers as possible. I flew 328 sorties to that end and would describe my abilities as being average among the pilots, which means I was very good. All of us were highly trained volunteers with soaring morale. We were ideal fighting machines operating on orders from the president of the United States, who was commander in chief of the strongest military and economic force in the world. I assume that our soldiers, sailors and Marines also were highly trained. So why did we lose that war? I think there are many answers. Let me tell you about one. \nA holding camp for prisoners of war was several miles from Tuy Hoa, South Vietnam, where I was stationed. A friend and I happened upon it while visiting a wounded buddy who was in a nearby Army hospital. The prison consisted of a 10-foot-wide circular plot of dirt surrounded by razor wire. It looked like some lazy jailerâ€™s afterthought. There was no door, no bed, no toilet, no water and no nothing except one lonely-looking Viet Cong prisoner. Although he appeared to be a young man, his face looked archaeological, with mud and wrinkles for definition, and he had a profusion of long black hair that suffered no organization on his head. \n\nMy friend and I walked up to him with blank faces and he forced a guarded, blank face back. As there was no one else around, we studied him from 3 feet away. We had not seen a prisoner before, and this one was easy to pity because he looked so frightened. I felt empty inside and wished for earlier times when distinctions between right and wrong were simpler made. \n\nHe had been newly captured by South Korean soldiers and wore only flimsy, short pants and shoes. His malaise was acute, probably with good reason, and he didnâ€™t appear to be enjoying any of the routine advantages of fantasy. \n\nWhen a jeep pulled up and a sergeant stepped out with food, water, a portable outhouse, some socks and a pair of GI brogans, I felt better. Thatâ€™s when I noticed what the prisoner had on his feet, and I was quickly introduced to the cold, grim face of life for jungle warriors. He was wearing sandals carved from a truck tire with straps from a rubber inner-tube. After all of my training I could not help but feel inadequate. \n\nAfter he put on his new boots his grin said that he was elated, not only because he had footwear that would last him many years, but because he could now wallow in the realization that no one was there to kill him. \n\nWhen my friend lit a cigarette the prisoner indicated that he also would like one. After a few minutes of hand haggling and grinning, we traded a package of cigarettes for his sandals. It seemed that we had become friends and were strangely satisfied, especially me because I was the proud new owner of a pair of war souvenirs that would give me bragging rights back home, and two reminders of a lost cause. \n\nAs I sit here by my little fire, 43 years later, my mind harkens to that innocent event. I wonder what happened to my friend behind the concertina wire, and hope that heâ€™s at home with his family. For some reason I feel like the college boy who crammed all week for a test, then flunked it. Why had I flown so many missions trying to kill this man? \n\nI had fought in a war that was waged mostly for philosophical reasons designed by men who never allowed their sense of morality to get in the way of what they mistakenly thought was the right thing to do. \n\nWith a tenuous peace in Iraq and a war in Afghanistan that continues to weary us, I canâ€™t help but wonder how historians will write the final accounting of those conflicts. Perhaps in the future we should more carefully weigh our possible gain from similar involvements against the probable toll, lest we suffer punitive atomic reprisals on our own soil. With all of our military superiority we lost the war in Vietnam, in part because we were fighting an enemy who was less encumbered by politics, and whose soldiers could readily make their own shoes from old truck tires."

There are dangers involved. Things can complicate the searchâ€” earthquakes, mudslides, forest fires, floods, trees, falling rocks.

Some have not been prepared to face the elements after they parked their car and started walking. Some have lacked the proper clothing, food and water...rode 28 miles on a bicycle in the snow and almost froze after getting wet...What serious adventurers should remember is to not believe anything that is not in my poem or otherwise in my book. Thereâ€™s some misinformation out there. For instance, I never said I buried the chest, I said only that I hid it. That is not to say it is not buried, so maybe we need to define the terms. Does â€˜hiddenâ€™ mean in plain sight? What is the difference between â€˜buried,â€™ â€˜entombedâ€™ and â€˜sepulturedâ€™? What does the word â€˜blazeâ€™ in the poem mean? A horse can have a blaze on its forehead, a blaze can be scraped on a tree to mark oneâ€™s way, a blaze can mean a flame or a scar on a rock. And what about â€˜water highâ€™?

Iâ€™ll be deploying again at the end of the year and the taste of adventure will pass the time as I count the days down.  I think Iâ€™m going to start in Wyoming and end the trip in the mountains of Montana.  Even if I come home without any bounty, the adventure will be unforgettable.  Thank you for your service to the country and thank you again for this brilliant and exciting mission!",I joined the AF as a private and made buck Sgt. before going to pilot training. I stayed 20 years and 24 days. The military was good for me and to me. Thank you for your service also. F

5883,10/2/12,http://dalneitzel.com/2012/10/02/forrest-gets-mail/,"Recently, I purchased one of Eric Sloaneâ€™s books from the Collected Works Bookstore, â€œA Reverence for Woodâ€ù. I didnâ€™t know if I would like it or not, maybe it would have a lot of technical terms in it and not being that knowledgeable about wood, maybe it would be boring to read.  The title of the book was so interesting to me, however, that it was important to me that I read it.\n\nAt 8 years of age, my reading skills were not good so my mother thought she would foster in me a love of reading by buying me the books she loved to read when she was little.  They were books written by Laura Ingalls Wilder.  The first two given me were, â€œLittle House in the Big Woodsâ€ù and â€œLittle House on the Prairieâ€ù. I was supposed to read 10 pages every night.  Pretty soon, nobody was forcing me to read anything. My mother always bought me two books at a time and in about two years or so I owned them all.  I loved those books and read them over and over until the pages started looking ragged and the backs fell off of them.  I kept reading them even when I was older and my reading skills had outgrown these childrenâ€™s books.\n\nWhat was so interesting to me was what life was like for a little pioneer girl in the 1800s.  The stories had so much detail on how they cooked their food, made their clothes, built their homes and lived their lives with almost complete independence.  It was easy to see how much pride someone could have in growing and raising most everything they ate or making everything they used.  When a family traveled  to a new place in a covered wagon, they couldnâ€™t take much with them.  Maybe some pretty dishes to display in their new home, a few books, the family bible, their clothes and bedding. Lauraâ€™s pa built their homes himself, made a table for dining, frames for their beds, rocking chair for Ma, a barn, etc and he made it all out of wood.  I could see how wood was so essential to their lives. I also loved the illustrations in the books.  They were all drawings and over time, they were as familiar and precious to me as the stories themselves.\n\nAs I read Mr Sloaneâ€™s book, I was struck by how it made me feel about times long gone, just like my beloved books of my youth.  I could understand how he felt about wood and what it meant to people one hundred or two hundred years ago. Through trying to figure out where your treasure is hidden, I have gone off on numerous tangents, researching even the people you mention in your book.   I might never have heard of Eric Sloane if I hadnâ€™t read your book and so I thank you.",It is nice to be able to touch someone once in a while. F

This is his response to the criticism,"This is going to get me in trouble but I have to say it. The following words have nothing to do with the treasure chest I hid, and they will give no hints or associations to its location.\n\nSearching for hidden treasures in the mountains is enjoyable. It brings families together, it promotes bonding and it gets kids off the streets, out of the game rooms and away from their texting machines. During rough economic times, it provides hopes and dreams where otherwise they might be lacking. It is both healthy and mind expanding. And it utilizes the great outside for the purpose it was intended. I have 14,442 emails that have told me those things.\n\nI am sorry that someone was arrested for digging a small hole in the ground. In the scope of world events, surely it should not have made the front page and NBC news. It is beyond me why anyone would want to prosecute that man. If I were his judge, I would fine him ten bucks and tell him not to do it again. What has happened to our basic senses? There are those who will tell me that I do not understand the problem, and they will be right, I donâ€™t.\n\nLet us put things in perspective and look at them from a different slant. There are 654,885,389 acres of land in the United States that are owned by the American people. That is what the federal government admits is â€œpublic property.â€ù And the population of this great country is 313,914,040. After doing the math I learn that my allotment is exactly 2.086 acres.\n\nNow, what if I wanted to secret a can of Dr. Pepper under a rock in the cooling waters of a rivulet somewhere in my allotted public acreage? If I did, I would not need to use all of my area, I would need just 7.5 fluid ounces and 90 calories of space. And I would still have about 2.08555 acres remaining. Seems fair to me but would I have broken the law? Yes or No? If yes, then let us change the law because who knows where that nonsense could end. If no, then why are we getting so excited about the little things?"

Kim\n\nP.S. Iâ€™m glad you were okay!","Thank you Kim,\n\nI enjoyed the Laotian jungle. I spent the night under tall trees that had orchids climbing their sides as far up as I could see. It wasnâ€™t hot or cold, and it didnâ€™t rain, but it sure got dark. Small animals scampered around making scratching noises, but generally the jungle was damp, which deadened many of the sounds.\n\nI knew that tigers and cobras were in the jungle with me, but I figured a chance encounter would be rare.\n\nMy biggest threat was behind me.\n\nMy airplane was burning and things were happening fast. There was the real possibility that I would be hurt in the ejection or on the landing in the trees. A broken bone would have been bad. Bullets had shattered my canopy so there was a threat that my ejection system wouldnâ€™t work. That meant I would have to go over the side and manually pull the ripcord on my parachute. I really didnâ€™t want to do that. And there was a remote possibility that a bullet had impacted my tightly packed parachute, and jammed it. If that had happened my worries would have been over.\n\nI was about 1,500â€™ above the trees when I squeezed the two ejection triggers. For the next few seconds I was just along for the ride. Several procedures worked automatically, a cannon in a telescope attached to my seat blew me out of the airplane. At the end of the telescope a rocket fired and propelled me up another 150â€™. Then a â€œbutt kickerâ€ù strap reeled in and forced me away from the seat. I was still going up when my chute deployed, and luck was with me when it hung up in the trees. I was 18â€ù off the ground.\n\nLooking back now I must say that I enjoyed every second of that experience. The next morning a Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopter hoisted me up on a cable about 260 feet through the trees, damaging my body enough to get me a Purple Heart. Then it was up and away to Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, for a cup of coffee, some scrambled eggs, and a needed nap. Things just worked for me Kim, and it canâ€™t get much better than that. f"

Over half of my life had been spent in the military. I wanted to collect antiques, so I traded and bought my way into an art gallery in Santa Fe. I built my business around the premise that something doesnâ€™t have to be expensive to be wonderful... Ralph Lauren has the most wonderful talent of persuasion. Once he was in my home looking at my Indian bonnet collection, and he wanted my favorite, a particularly nice Crow hat covered with white ermine skins and carved antelope horns. I told him it wasnâ€™t for sale. He said, 'You have so many, and you canâ€™t take them with you.' So I said, 'Then Iâ€™m not going.' He just laughed.... Sitting Bullâ€™s catlinite pipe is one, and an early Hidatsa painted buffalo robe. But my collection is mostly made up of things that speak to me in a personal way. Some of my Plains Indian dolls that were made for little girls to play with have human scalps sewn on for hair and tell of a much earlier time, when attitudes and emotions ran in a different direction. My favorite piece is the little arrow point I found when I was nine. When I look at it today, I can still see my fatherâ€™s face smiling because he knew I was so excited... The ranch on which San Lazaro Pueblo sits was in foreclosure, and an archaeologist wanted to bulldoze the rooms and look for pots. So I rushed out, purchased the foreclosure, and paid off the liens. These sacred ruins need a guardian. Weâ€™re conserving thousands of artifacts, including a carved wooden human effigy with obsidian eyes and mouth, and prehistoric kachina dance masks that were not known to exist before we started digging... Iâ€™ve always been independent and somewhat impulsive, and I like to do things without a goal or strategy. Thereâ€™s a freedom in not making decisions until the last minute. My best hours have been flying at five hundred (500) feet, looking for Indian ruins or following a river through a winding canyon, not knowing or caring where I might spend the nightâ€”even sleeping on a riverbank if thereâ€™s no motel. My wife cringes when I tell her these things, because she thinks roughing it means no room service. But sheâ€™s always allowed me to just go do it. How can life get better than that?"

It was raining when a buddy dropped me off on his way to somewhere else. Peggy and I had been dating since our early grades in high school and everyone considered me part of her clan. At the time, I was a PFC in the Air Force making $95 a month, and attending Radar Mechanics School in Biloxi, Mississippi. I was on the red-eye shift, 1800 to midnight. \n\nSunday evening came too early and I had to be in school the next afternoon or really bad things would happen to me. The Korean War was new and the military was unreasonable about discipline. PFCs were easy targets. \n\nI told Peggy to not worry about me and when I heard her front door reluctantly close behind me, it was dark and Biloxi was more than two hundred (200) miles away. \n\nAfter walking a couple of blocks while holding my little suitcase over my head against the irrational moisture, I heard voices coming from a little church just ahead. The front doors were open and the warm incandescent lights were compelling. When two ladies saw me dripping in the vestibule they rushed over, and with typical Cajun hospitality, pulled me inside for coffee. \n\nThe congregation was playing Bingo. All of a sudden I was in a completely different world. I didnâ€™t have enough coins to jingle, but I did have a quarter, just one quarter, and the sign on the wall said â€œCards â€“ 25 Cents.â€ù What the heck, I thought, and I invested all of my cash. There were three winners in the first game and I was one of them. Now I had $3.75, and hope was flickering. \n\nThe bus station was three blocks away and I started running. The drizzle stopped bothering me. When the ticket man told me the fare to Biloxi was $3.95, I felt numb. I spread all of my money on the counter and asked if I could please buy a ticket with that amount? \n\nHis finger started counting and with each word he spoke my pulse rate increased. Our eyes locked for an eternity and then he said, ""No you canâ€™t buy a ticket with that amount,"" still looking at me hard, ""but Iâ€™ll give you 20 cents."" I waved to my friend behind the counter as I climbed into the bus. He was smiling, and I knew everything would be alright. \n\nI came away from that experience with some thoughts to live by. \n\nThere is no such thing as a self-made man. \nGive it your best shot and see what happens. \nNever underestimate the power of a quarter. \nGive some of it back when it is needed. \n"

Wilson Hurley was an artist, and a good one. The price of his paintings frequently ran up to around $100,000 for the larger ones. He was entertaining in a conversation. His father was Patrick Hurley, who, during WW2 was Ambassador to China. As a kid Wilson travelled widely with his father and he had personal letters from Generals MacArthur and Eisenhower. In 1945, Wilson graduated from West Point and became a pilot in the Air Force, serving as a forward air controller in Vietnam. We always had plenty to talk about. Well, sometime in the 1980s probably, some guy ran a red light and hit Wilsonâ€™s car. The jolt pinched a nerve in his neck. He was incapacitated, unable to paint for a year maybe. He couldnâ€™t make a living so he sued, and it went to court in Albuquerque. Since I had a gallery in Santa Fe and sold Wilsonâ€™s paintings, I was called to testify as an expert witness about the value of his work, and how much money he lost by not being able to paint. I was duly sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Problem was I didnâ€™t like the defense attorney at first sight, and every sight after that. I didnâ€™t know the jerk, but he was someone I very much enjoyed not caring for. His villainous face and bulging eyes made him look like Peter Lorre. The judge broke with tradition and wore a blue robe, my favorite color. The scene was set with only a few spectators. \n\nWell, most of the questions from the jerkâ€™s mouth came out reeking with sarcastic idioms that were aimed at discrediting me. He covertly insinuated that I was a derelict witness, not qualified to be on the stand. I was happily getting fed up with this guy. When one of my answers turned into a short dissertation, the defense jerk interrupted me. â€œYes or no, Mister Fenn, yes or no,â€ù he yelled in a croaky belligerent voice. All of a sudden the court room was a very hostile environment. I just sat there as the lawyerâ€™s eyes captured me. It was like a 40 pound turkey staring at a June bug. \n\nI turned to the bench and said, very apologetically, â€œJudge, I swore to tell the truth and the whole truth. If the defense attorney wonâ€™t allow me to do that I must respectfully withdraw my oath.â€ù There was silence in the court as everyone sat stunned. The defense attorney looked like heâ€™d just crawled out from under a garbage truck. I posed straight ahead and tried to stay collected, hoping the judge wouldnâ€™t cite me for contempt. \n\nFinally he called the lawyers into chambers and as they disappeared, and the door slammed, I relaxed. It could go either way, I thought. When Wilson, who was also a lawyer, saw the jury feigning snickers his frown turned to a smile. When the legal force returned, the judge said I could answer the questions as I pleased, and I was re-sworn. I ducked that bullet with impressive form. Wilson agreed. \n\nSurely what I did was not only legal, but necessary, although no one had ever heard of a witness being unsworn before. At lunch Wilson paid. I ordered chicken fried steak with the gravy on the side, and no veggies. It had been a good day. f\n"

Most are highly researched, well written, too technical, and dull as cold oatmeal. Câ€™mon you guys, itâ€™s not like tornados are stopped in mid-air by archaeology, or famines prevented, or even terrible diseases cured for crimanny sake. Loosen up some. In 2004, when I wrote a book about my excavations at San Lazaro Pueblo I tried to change the archaeological norm by adding some levity. The book is quoted in technical journals, but credit is not given. They donâ€™t like land owners excavating ruins on their own land so they ignore me. Thatâ€™s okay because Iâ€™m having more fun than they are. Many archaeologists are really good guys, like David Hurst Thomas, who is Curator of Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. He is loose, and heâ€™s analyzing the San Lazaro church bell fragments for me. The secret is to not get too excited about the little things. f"

Later, he bought all of the remaining copies from the publisher so he could re-issue it into a special bicentennial edition. It never happened, and my copy, a gift from the author, is one of those he wished to modify, but didnâ€™t. Eric loved bells, and noted that under ideal conditions their rings can be heard nine miles distant. He said, â€œThe far-away sound of a bell could be both â€œforlorn and soul-stirring.â€ù Funny I remembered that. I acquired this generic cast iron train bell from Eric. He probably apprehended it from some old wrecked steam locomotive somewhere, but who knows? The bell has the loudest clang in our whole area. I know that from how many miles away I get complaints. The support upon which the bell rests held up the roof in Kiva A at San Lazaro Pueblo. The Dendrochronology Lab at the U of Arizona said the tree was cut in 1475 plus a few years added for residual rottage. That means it was cut with prehistoric stone tools because metal did not come to the pueblo for at least another 65 years. It was set 24 inches into the ground, and thatâ€™s about as deep as a manâ€™s arm can reach and hand-dig the dirt out. At my home I cut the post to fit, tarred the bottom 24 inches and placed it back in the ground. Then I mounted the bell on top. My wife rings it to summon me when Iâ€™m working way out in the trees. One ring means come to supper, two means carry the trash out, and three means â€œCome at once, I need you.â€ù I always do what she rings. Because it personally cannot relate its history, my bell tower invites little more than a curious glance. I wonder if the owners of my home a hundred years from now will appreciate the dichotomy that stands just off the east end of my portal. f\n"

Maybe he couldnâ€™t decide which part he wanted to keep warm. I donâ€™t know about that, but I do know that in the 1860s, and 70s, he struck a pretty wide swath through Eastern New Mexico and across the Staked Planes of North Texas. From south of Lubbock to north of Amarillo and into Oklahoma, the land was table-flat, and almost totally devoid of trees. You may be able to guess how the little town of Plainview got its name. The women who travelled the long miles across that brushless country on horseback were frequently embarrassed to the point of mortification, but the men probably didnâ€™t care. \n\nThat was Indian country, and the Comanches under Chief Quanah Parker were raiding, and plundering with resolve. Jose didnâ€™t care. He traded the Indians cattle, horses, rifles, ammo, whisky, and anything else he could steal. President Grant got fed up, and the order came down, â€œControl the Indians no matter what you have to do.â€ù In September of 1874, General Randal S. Mackenzie and his 4th US Calvary went looking for Quanah and couldnâ€™t find him. So they tied Jose Tafoya to a wagon wheel and tortured him until he revealed where the Comanches were camped in the Palo Duro. With that knowledge the soldiers swept into the canyon, routed the Indians, burned their lodges, and killed 2,000 horses. With winter coming, and their stores gone, the 1,500 Comanches were forced to seek shelter under Army supervision at Ft. Sill. Quanah was mad at his old friend. â€œIf I ever catch Jose Tafoya Iâ€™ll boil him in oil.â€ù With that said, the big Comanchero, his wife and four children, retired to his sheep ranch in New Mexico where he died in 1913. \n\nThe life or death of a Comanchero on the Staked Plains in those days often hung on the whim of a trigger finger. Rarely is it written in the annals of western history that someone like Jose would live to be 83 years old. \n\nA personal note: \n\nI was about to cast this 28-inch portrait of Jose Tafoya in an old abandoned grain elevator in Lubbock. It was 1969, and I was still in the Air Force. Bill McClure, the artist, was standing there as I put finishing touches on the wax model. â€œIâ€™m not happy with his shirt,â€ù Bill said. So I soaked an old piece of potato-sack burlap in hot wax, and with thick rubber gloves, I draped it around Joseâ€™s shoulders. Bill was laughing at me. When I poured the piece in bronze every detail in the burlap came out perfectly, and gave me the effect I wanted. Bill too, and he agreed that I should be credited as co-artist. We sold that bronze, and both Bill and I made a few bucks that were badly needed. More than twenty years later, I was happy to buy the bronze back from the man I sold it to. Being a pioneer is really fun. f\n"

Being an early student of their history, and an avid collector of their clothing, weapons, and photographs, my imagination long ago fell prey to their way of life. Historians call them the â€œLords of the Plains,â€ù and that name is well-merited because no other tribe could sit a horse and ride with such a handsome manner. Of special interest to me is the Quahada band, and Quanah Parker especially. His father was Peta Nakona, chief of the Quahadas, and his mother was Cynthia Ann Parker, a white woman who, in 1836, was captured by the Comanches. She lived with them for 24 years, and had three children. When she was â€œrescuedâ€ù by Sul Ross, a Texas Ranger, and returned to her people, Cynthia Ann couldnâ€™t speak the language. She yearned to go back, a plea that was repeatedly denied. After a few years she stopped eating and died. The doctors said it was influenza. \n\nOn October the 10th, 1871, during the Battle of Blanco Canyon, Quanah Parker rode up to Trooper Gregg of the 4th US Cavalry and shot him with a Smith and Wesson American. The trooper was interred where he fell and rocks were placed on his grave. Captain R.G. Carter, a witness to the event, said Greggâ€™s horse was faltering, and gave this written account: A large and powerfully built chief led the bunch, on a coal-black racing pony. Leaning forward upon his mane, his heels nervously working in the animalâ€™s side, with six-shooter poised in air, he seemed the incarnation of savage brutal joy. His face was smeared with black war paint, which gave his features a satanic look. A large, cruel mouth added to his ferocious appearance. A full-length headdress or war bonnet of eagleâ€™s feathers, spreading out as he rode, and descending from his forehead, overhead and back, to his ponyâ€™s tail, almost swept the ground. Large brass hoops were in his ears; he was naked to his waist, wearing simply leggings, moccasins and a breechclout. A necklace of bearâ€™s claws hung about his neck. His scalp lock was carefully braided in with otter fur, and tied with bright red flannel. His horseâ€™s bridle was profusely ornamented with bits of silver, and red flannel was also braided in his mane and tail, but, being black, he was not painted. Bells jingled as he rode at headlong speed, followed by the leading warriors, all eager to outstrip him in the race. It was Quanah, principal war chief of the wild Qua-ha-das. \n\nCaptain Carter, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his action in the fight, drew a map of the battle, which loosely identified the burial location. Ninety-five years later, when I was stationed in Lubbock, a friend, Bill Griggs, and I searched relentlessly for the trooperâ€™s grave. The evidence showed it to be somewhere about 46 miles north of where I lived. \n\nWith Captain Carterâ€™s original map in hand (I didnâ€™t want to carry a copy.) Bill and I hiked on weekends. Back and forth across the grassy rises and rugged dips we walked, binoculars in hand. We were ever watchful for the errant pile of rocks that were deliberately placed to keep scavenging animals from digging. Twenty days or more we did that, often finding remnants of the fight, a canteen, a rusty knife, a brass cavalry uniform button, lots of bullet casings, but no pile of rocks. We replaced everything as it lay, lest we betray the sanctity of that battle ground. We didnâ€™t locate Trooper Greggâ€™s resting place. My wish now is that the chaparral and long-living creosote bushes will protect that soldier and permit him to rest in the dignity of the North Texas soil where Mother Wind will forever wail the long mournful sound of Taps. My motive for searching was important to me. I just wanted to stand there and render one last salute to the fallen fighter, and to â€œwatchâ€ù as hundreds of yelping natives and Army troopers fought one of the most decisive battles of the Indian Wars. I would like to have thrown a rock at Quanah as he sped by on his â€œcoal-black racing pony.â€ù Please allow me to explain something. \n\nI would like to have known R. G. Carter, but he died when I was 5 years old. I collected his personal papers, letters, documents, and books, so I probably have more information about him than anyone alive today. \n\nNow, about Quanah Parker. J. Evetts Haley and I went to the spot in the Palo Duro Canyon where, in 1874, General Mackenzie routed the Comanches, including Quanah. Visiting his gravesite at the Ft. Sill Indian Cemetery where heâ€™s buried beside his mother and daughter (Prairie Flower), was a spiritual experience for me. I just love the Indian history of this country. Thank you. f\n"

Theyâ€™re probably 20th century Spanish or from over there someplace. The rooster weighs 70 pounds, and is almost 2â€™ tall. Hereâ€™s a photo of the hen. Both were rusty brown and ugly-dull finished. I really liked those things, but my wife saw them on our kitchen table asked if I was okay, and felt my forehead to see if I had a temperature. That suddenly gave me terrible buyerâ€™s remorse. I looked at the chickens again and out in the garage they went. It really bothers me to make art mistakes like that. And then I thought of my friend Joe Anna Arnett. \n\nNo one in the world is better at painting still life florals than she is, and you have to love her as a person. Thatâ€™s an envious position for anyone to be in. A call to Joe Anna brought her running with her husband, Jim Asher, who also is a world class painter, a watercolorist. Joe Anna took one look at my rooster and groped for the nearest chair. Iâ€™m sure she was thinking, â€œOh my, what did I do to deserve this?â€ù She had never put paint on an iron rooster before, at least not a tall, heavy, cold, brown one. She was not smiling when I put that thing in the back of her car. At home, Jim put it by a heater to warm it up, probably hoping it would melt. \n\nI didnâ€™t hear from Joe Anna for a month, then one day an email came in. She wanted to bring my chicken home. I just knew she was weary of it, and whatever catastrophes that occurred in her studio would probably be my fault. Maybe it fell over and broke her paint box, or the weight of it collapsed a leg on her Woodbridge table and sent her coffee cup splashing across the floor. I didnâ€™t feel too good. \n\nThe iron rooster was covered with a black garbage bag when Jim put it on my table, and stepped back behind the counter. I looked at Joe Anna and she looked at me, neither of us smiling. After a long few seconds, she nodded toward the plastic bag, insinuating that I should pull it off. Wow, this is what was under the bag. When Joe Anna saw me grinning she started laughing, and we hugged. I love it when I make really great art decisions. f \n\nGoogle them and look at their paintings. \nJames Asher Santa Fe \nJoe Anna Arnett \n"

He was fun, decisive, and he had money. His long chalk-white hair didnâ€™t abide by anyoneâ€™s decorum, certainly not his own. He always came into my gallery with a male assistant who carried a large humidor. While he was in coat and tie, Gene wore a relaxed collar and a thread-bare cashmere sweater. Everything he was or did made you like him. He was especially fond of my wife and she always came running when his call for her boomed through the gallery. \n\nGene collected art, and when he bought a painting the humidor lid came off, and a top thin tray of cigars was set aside. All that remained was two layers of paper money so tightly packed in that you couldnâ€™t tell what it was. \n\nAt our first meeting, he left me with 350 one hundred dollar bills. As they were counted out on our front desk, I felt a little uncomfortable. I had not seen anything like that before. A check doesnâ€™t look like much money, but 350 big bills spread out was a different view for me. \n\nGene was a preacher with a long list of important religious achievements. I often watched him on his Sunday morning television program. His chair was on the front edge of a huge stage and he sat there each Sunday wearing a different hat. It was almost like he wore them chronologically by type. His stage was bare, but for his chair, a small table that held a pitcher of water and a glass. Thatâ€™s all. The preacher almost looked swallowed up. But he spoke with a melodic voice that was mesmerizing as the golden bible verses rolled through his lips and were distributed to his audience of thousands. They sat rapt as he talked about human frailties, apostles, scriptures, prophets, and sin. I wondered if his viewers were paying him by the word. \n\nDuring the commercials, which were rare, Pastor Scott was at his best. Quite often he would say something like, â€œOkay my friends, I need a new car. Please send money to our church,â€ù as an address flashed on the screen. They responded in droves, and Gene probably had a lot of automobiles.  Everything they gave him was legal and tax free, to both him and them, but not me. When I walked into my bank carrying a big sack of money, other customers stared and the tellers smiled. When I sold my gallery, in 1988, I lost track of Gene. He died seventeen years later. But the memory of that indelible man has not faded. It has been easy for me to hold his image. f\n"

He died ten years into our relationship, but they were significant times for me, and I hope they were worthwhile for him. In a perfect world everyone would have their very own Eric.

It was not unusual for her to bring celebrities in to meet me, and I loved that. And I equally loved that she could write a check for nearly anything she wanted, a fact that did not go undetected by my banker. \n\nEveryone loved Pony, especially me. She was a chatterbox conversationalist so I always gravitated to her at parties, dinners, and art openings. She took chitchatting to an intellectual plateau that was several layers above where I normally felt ease. Our discussion time found me mostly listening, smiling, and nodding. Being seen with her was always good for my sometimes flailing ego. \n\nPony said she wanted a painting by Robert Henri (1865-1929), so I started looking. The problem was that she had a great eye for art, a trait that never worked to the advantage of art dealers. When discussing art Pony nearly always knew more about the artist whose work was hanging on my walls, than I did. So when we talked price I was somewhat disarmed and usually capitulated to what she delicately described as her â€œmedicinal discount.â€ù \n\nHenri paintings were very important and quite valuable so my eyes were always on alert for his name in auction catalogs. After a few weeks I bought one. It was a picture of a little girl named Graciella. But for some unknown reason it didnâ€™t appeal to me. Her face was, well, I donâ€™t know. So we hung it on the wall in my office opposite my desk. Every time I sat in my chair, there she was, her stern face staring at me. I didnâ€™t expect to actually warm up to Graciella, but at least I hoped we could establish some kind of meaningful rapport. \n\nWhen I called Pony she made an appointment for the next afternoon. She wanted me to meet Cary Grant. I couldnâ€™t have been more thrilled because To Catch a Thief was one of my favorite movies. When they entered my office, introductions were made and I shook hands with the debonair Mr. Grant. We talked for several minutes and then Pony turned around. \n\nAnd there it was in grand lighting, the Graciella Henri. It was hanging where it had been for a month while I tried to warm up to that little girl. No other clients were allowed to see her because I was saving it for my special client. \n\nWell, Pony immediately recognized the artistâ€™s style, palette, subject, and personality. She wasnâ€™t impressed, and as if possessed by the spirit of Thor, she turned to face me. â€œIs that what you called me down here for, to look at that thang?â€ù Her face looked unsympathetic as her nose pointed toward the 17th century wooden door to my office, beside which one must pass to exit, and out she strode, the sensitive Mister Grant silently following in close trail. Neither of them even said goodbye. \n\nGulp! \n\nI went to my refrigerator and took a long pull of Worcestershire Sauce to clear my head. \n\nPony liked to show off our gallery to her lunching friends and house guests, so over the next few weeks she strolled them into my office and acted as docent. Often she was seen to glance at the You-Know-What that was hanging on the wall opposite my desk. Each time she left without comment. I didnâ€™t care because Graciella and I were becoming friends. \n\nDuring an evening art opening at our gallery Pony open the door to my office and sneaked in. She was in there for a minute or more. Thatâ€™s when I started to worry. \n\nA week later she called me on the phone. â€œForrest I want that painting, and Iâ€™ll be there in thirty minutes to get it.â€ù My heart sank. â€œPony,â€ù I lamented. â€œYou didnâ€™t say anything and Iâ€™ve grown to love that â€œthang.â€ù Iâ€™ve decided to keep it in my own collection.â€ù There was a gravid few-second pause in our conversation, necessitated by a requirement for Pony to recover. Then a loud sound vibrated against my ear drum. â€œWhat?â€ù she sputtered. I felt like my tail was under a rocking chair, and Pony was sitting in it. \n\nWhat could I do but capitulate? After all, she was a good friend and she was a good client, and I did offer it to her, and I sensed that she was about to have an unfortunate physical issue. Not to mention that I needed the money. \n\nAn hour later my wife walked into the office and asked why I was reading my bible. I didnâ€™t mean to be rude, I just didnâ€™t want to talk about it. f\n"

They probably did and I just wasnâ€™t paying attention. So in later life, when I became interested in words and how they were used, I naturally gravitated to a trial and error style of writing that suited me best. In 2011, when my book, The Thrill of the Chase, co-won an award for best independently published book of the year, I received a letter from the judges. It said my entry was among other things, childish, which they must have thought was pretty good because otherwise how could I have won the award? It started me thinking about how different people write. William F. Buckley Jr. was one of my heroes. I saw him once in an airport in Newark and he looked straight at me, so Iâ€™ll call him Bill. Bill had a daily column in the NY Times. When he got on the commuter train in Connecticut each morning he didnâ€™t know what he would write about, but when he alit an hour later in New York City, his creation was finished. He rarely rewrote, he said, and no one ever dared to edit him. While his method is on the Technicolor end of the writing spectrum, mine is on the black and white. Thatâ€™s okay with me because our composing modes are diabolically opposed to each other. \n\nMy habit when writing something short, is to decide on a subject, then start gathering sentences together with some kind of focus, but not much direction. They need to stay close to the topic and carry my theme or plot to the end of the story. Often, the thoughts come rushing out as I think along. One notion propagates the next. Sometimes I canâ€™t type fast enough. \n\nThen I retreat to the beginning and try to reorganize my words into some kind of acceptable cohesive unit. How can I say a line better and keep it in the same flavor as the others? Is this sentence too predictable? Do I want to misspell a word to make the reader stop and look it up, and maybe feel a need to respond? Itâ€™s okay if the reader wants to work with me. I use other techniques too, like corrupting a word or idea. In my Thrill book I wrote about courting my wife. â€œEveryone knew she was too good for me, but tenacity was never one of my shortcomings.â€ù That sort of thing causes the kind of word-of-mouth publicity that I need because I self-publish and donâ€™t have any distribution. And itâ€™s my way of keeping a readerâ€™s attention fresh. If one knows exactly what I mean then who cares what the word is, or how itâ€™s used. Educated editors disapprove of me en-masse, but they donâ€™t have a Pulitzer either. \n\nI am frequently criticized for where I put commas. My reply is that I donâ€™t want to use anybodyâ€™s book-writing rules. It is my prerogative as the writer to decide when I want the reader to pause, not the readerâ€™s, and certainly not the criticâ€™s. Cormac McCarthy was known to write a story and then go back and remove all of the commas. The hardest part of writing for me is sitting down and getting started. Some of my techniques develop themselves as I write along. For instance, I learned when researching my J. H. Sharp biography that the elderly Taos Indian models wouldnâ€™t answer my questions about the artist. I quickly discovered that if I said something to them that I knew was wrong, they would correct me, on and on, and tell me things I wanted to know. Success sometimes hides in squinting wrappings, but a delicate new bow, if tied correctly, can widen eyes. \n\nI wrote this someplace a few years ago and maybe youâ€™ll think itâ€™s worth remembering, Imagination isnâ€™t a technique, itâ€™s a key. f\n"

Itâ€™s a hip pocket flask that was made to hold a â€œ3/16th pintâ€ù of libation. It says so right there on the bottom. The silver overlay on the bottle is applied by a complex chemical procedure. If it was a Russian icon, youâ€™d have to call it an oklad, but this is different. \n\nThe swirly engraved initials near the bottom were adeptly applied, ostensibly to identify the owner who will always remain a mystery to me because I canâ€™t read the fancy letters. At the 1949 Masterâ€™s Golf Tournament I observed a nattily dressed gentleman use a pair of binoculars to watch Sam putt on the 10th green. It was a little strange because the man was standing less than thirty feet away from where the putt was about to be made. \n\nAnd then I noticed something. The fan wasnâ€™t watching golf at all. He also held a flask in his hands, and every time he raised the binoculars to his eyes, he took a swig from the bottle. It was a subterfuge that very effectively disguised his odd drinking practice. No one seemed to notice but me, and just as Sam drew his putter back to make the stroke, the natty guy hiccupped, causing the putt to jerk left a few inches and unceremoniously roll past the hole. I felt partially to blame just because I was watching it. As the crowd moved to the next tee the binocular guy was noticeably teetering to the starboard side. Thatâ€™s why I moved to the 13th fairway and watched Jimmy Demaret hit his mashie niblick shot to the green. Sam Snead won the tournament so I went home happy. \n\nSurely it wonâ€™t be long before our government enacts legislation that prohibits anyone from drinking and watching golf at the same time. f\n"

That was 1972, and his sculptures had a small, but budding following in Scottsdale. Over the next few years Scottsdale was where most of the money for contemporary western art was coming from. About 20 collectors held up that market, and if there had been an art marquee in town someplace, a few names would have been at the top: Eddie Basha, Henry Topf, the wonderful widow Kieckhefer, Kay Miller (Miller Brewing Co), and more, but mostly Eddie Basha, who owned a large chain of grocery stores. \n\nDoug and I were a good combination, and we serviced those Arizona clients with an adroitness and polish the likeness of which I never witnessed again. Doug made hundreds of stone sculptures, Scottsdale wanted them, and I did the accommodating. \n\nMy wife and I liked Dougâ€™s work so much we kept two pieces for ourselves. This alabaster lady is not tall, just 2 feet, but sheâ€™s really heavy. Thatâ€™s why she has been sitting on our living room fireplace without moving for almost 30 years. I couldnâ€™t lift even half of her. She was isolated and lonesome. But then our great-granddaughter Arden came along, and at age two, fell in love with Lady Pretty Blanket. Thatâ€™s what I named the stone pueblo woman holding a pot. When the house was too quiet, weâ€™d look over there and see Arden and â€œLadyâ€ù sitting side by side talking to each other, and sometimes hugging. So of course we gave the sculpture to Arden, but she canâ€™t take possession until my wife and I are gone. Ha! Doug Hyde is mostly Nez Perce, and he possesses bold native features and a strong code of ethics. During the many years we worked together, mostly without contracts, there were nothing but handshakes and pleasantness. My other Doug Hyde sculpture is 27 inches tall. It epitomizes a dignified Nez Perce chief whose name has long been forgotten. His feather fan and drop-alongside ear rings testify as to his stature in the tribe. He stands facing the wall in my kitchen now because the sight reminds me of the great Henry Farny painting, The Song of the Singing Wire.  To me, both figures personify the west at a threshold moment when the first faint sound of change was beginning to resonate across the soundless mountains. The western atmosphere was moving fast to make room for the â€œgiant horse that gallops on iron rails.â€ù Thereâ€™s the same sadness in the painted Indianâ€™s face that I notice in Dougâ€™s sculpture. \n\nCan you see tears of sorrow building in the eyes of those two Plains warriors? I can, and I wish my inadequate words about that sentiment were more eloquent. Joe died at age 102 and was the last War Chief of the Crow Tribe. His great uncle, White Man Runs Him, was a scout for General Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Many years ago, Joe said to me in a wistful moment, â€œWhen I was just a little Indian kid running around, my elders told me about our history. I asked them if the government would ever give our future back to us.â€ù f\n"
6163,4/24/17,http://dalneitzel.com/2017/04/24/scrapbook-one-hundred-eighty-two/,N/A - Consolidated quotes appearing throughout the article.,"Rusted Remnants of History \n\nMy son-in-law, David Old, owns the 2,400 acre Viveash Ranch. It is just northeast of Pecos and up. Up to 10,637 feet. In 1977, his father died in a plane crash in Alaska, leaving David the ranch. The 45 minute drive from pavement up to the first gate is a shock absorber crushing ride over rocks that feel a special disdain for any modern conveyance. The ranch contains some of the most beautiful landscapes in America, with house-size rock outcroppings, 5 spring-fed ponds, and far-seeing mountain vistas. Animals are everywhere: elk, deer, turkey, and bear. Mountain lions, porcupines, and bobcats are also present. Bears have been known to break a window in the main cabin and thrash everything inside, including the refrigerator and pantry, causing general mayhem. Several years ago David shot a rifle bullet through the front door to stop a bear that was clawing, and close to getting in. I think little Piper frequently peeped through the hole to see what might be lurking just outside, lest she open the door to a big furry surprise. Each of the ponds contained trout that were fat from eating grasshoppers, crawfish, and unlucky water dwelling insects. Elk ate the cattails we planted, but the lily pads thrived. Fishing was good. Three pet llamas and five horses grazed the wooded high country, undisturbed for years. Then all of a sudden there were only two llamas. Shiloh blamed a mountain lion. There was always some grass, but occasionally during the dead winter months when the snow got deep, the pets retreated to the barn to wait for a chinook or a more enjoyable temperature. When necessary, Shiloh took hay up by snowmobile. Then came the Viveash fire that started May 29, 2000. In a terrible few days the ranch lost 17,000,000 board feet of standing timber. The sky turned so black that the animals must have thought midnight had arrived twelve hours early, and just stayed. Billowing clouds of smoke could be seen from as far away as Pikeâ€™s Peak. Commercial airliners were diverted. Scorching heat disappeared the vegetation down to hard pack, and below, destroying root systems that held the soil tight, and leaving a thick layer of ashes on top. Then the June monsoon thunderstorms arrived on schedule and washed the ashes downhill in a flowing mass that covered the ponds, and suffocated the fish. The smallest pond was boiled to its muddy, steaming bottom. \n\nTwo historic one-room log dwellings stood in the fireâ€™s path. The Viveash cabin was built in 1885 by Lionel Viveash, who suffered from leprosy. He lived in the cabin for 27 years before New Mexico became a state, and died a year after, in 1913. I hoped the fire would spare the cabin that had stood for 115 years, but it didnâ€™t. Only fire-rusted nails now remain to tell that man had once lived there, and soon they also will disappear as the land residuates, and no one will remember where they were. The history of that cabin, and another one, was deleted from the world. The beautiful sky-reaching ponderosa, pictured here being hugged by Shiloh, and many others like it, also succumbed to the heat and flames. In the fireâ€™s aftermath thousands of jet black ponderosa pine skeletons still stand erect, but without needles, as if to underscore the tragedy. I had walked across those timbered mountains and witnessed the wild, pristine wonders that were there: majestic pine trees, Douglas firs, aspens and scrub oaks. And to punctuate the expanse, a decoration of flowers: reds, yellows, purples, and the ever present white dayâ€™s eyes (daises). The green stalks of wild onions that we like to pull and eat were found throughout that colorful bouquet. \n\nAnd then to see it later, as miles of rusted cinders and grotesquely shaped rubble, was a shock that surpassed my ability to describe, or a desire to even try. The last vapors of smoke were still fading toward the Eastern Plains when the promise of a new beginning appeared. Someone said if your ship hasnâ€™t come in, swim out to it, and that is exactly what David and Shiloh did. They hired lumber crews. Chain saws began to buzz through the mountain quietness. A sawmill was quickly erected, and trucks laden with logs pounded the ashy roads. Thousands of trees that had endured for decades, then killed by natureâ€™s unreasonable wrath, were harvested. When faced with a catastrophic event, the father-and- son team didnâ€™t cry about the dead trees, they cut them down and made plank flooring, end grain wood blocks, and stylish three-dimensional wall paneling. A market was waiting, and the demand was met. Customers for major hotels, government buildings, and eight Starbucks stores as far away as Kuwait, are now walking on Viveash wooden floors supplied by Oldwood. \n\nAnd then, in 2013, as if to display another of natureâ€™s irritating moods, the Tres Lagunas Fire flashed through the trees, burning 860 acres on the west side of the Viveash Ranch. \n\nBut again the Old family looked to themselves for strength and ingenuity, and expanded their business. This year they will supply 130 semi-trailers of split firewood to a major retail outlet. \n\nNature frequently takes away, and in doing so she always looks at the big picture. Five-hundred years from now no one will remember the fires. But Iâ€™ll still be thinking about that great little Viveash cabin that disappeared. f \n\nPersonal note: The Fenn treasure chest is not hidden on or near the Viveash Ranch.\n"

Forrest Gist was his name, or Forest Gist, I donâ€™t remember which so Iâ€™ll call him Forrest because I like that name better. I had purchased one of his bowls from a store and gave it to my wife for her birthday. She liked it so much I thought it might be nice to get her another one for Christmas. (I hate that her birthday and Christmas are just 38 days apart). \n\nSo I went to see Forrest at a time when I knew he was firing about 30 pottery vessels in a large outdoor kiln. I arrived just in time to see him remove a still hot jar with a stick, look at it for a few seconds, then throw it on a cement sidewalk where it splattered. What thâ€_? \n\nI approached Forrest cautiously, not completely cognizant of his mindset, and remembering he had a hot stick in his hand. â€œWhatcha doinâ€™, Forrest?â€ù I asked respectively. He didnâ€™t answer, but instead, threw another hot jar on the pavement. This went on a couple of more times before I decided to be rude to my friend. \n\nâ€œStop, you idiot! Iâ€™ll buy some of those things from you.â€ù He turned to me and politely said, â€œLook Forrest, Iâ€™m experimenting with a new glaze here, and thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t sign the pots in this firing. I want quality to be my signature, and if they donâ€™t measure up to my standards I donâ€™t want my name on them.â€ù Gee, and I thought they were really good. \n\nI helped Forrest clean up the mess caused by the demise of one kiln-worth of fired clay â€œJunkers.â€ù And I had to admit that Forrest was the consummate artist. Although I didnâ€™t agree completely with his quality control methods, I respected his philosophy. \n\nWhat he had done prayed on my mind for a few days. I had already decided to be a world class bronze sculptor, and was sure my first two efforts were excellent platforms from which to launch my career. What I lacked in talent could be compensated for in other ways. For instance, since I couldnâ€™t get the hooves on my buffalo just right, I solved the problem by having him stand in mud. And my pilot self-portrait, well surely my talent would improve over time, maybe over a long time. \n\nGoing to Forrest Gistâ€™s pot firings ruined my promising art career, so I decided to be an art dealer instead. The two bronzes remain in my collection to remind me to not to ever try that again.\n\nQuality matters, and although no one should be allowed to set a standard for art, common-sense propriety must come into play at some point. My gallery purchased a drawing from a Yahoo artist for $15 because he wanted to buy a sandwich. \n\nOver the next several years no one wanted to buy that sad sketch from us at any price.  One day Mr. Yahoo saw it in a storage drawer with a price of $15, and he became irate. He didnâ€™t think we should be offering his early work because he had gotten better since then, and that sketch embarrassed him. When I offered to sell it back at my cost, he wasnâ€™t interested. Iâ€™m sure he knew non-quality when he saw it. He should have thrown it in the fire years ago instead of bringing it to me. My first impression of The Scream was that it should have been thrown in a spewing volcano. Never mind that not too long ago a pastel on cardboard version of it sold for about $120,000,000.00. Guess I donâ€™t know as much about art values as I thought I did. f\n"
6177,5/12/17,http://dalneitzel.com/2017/05/12/scrapbook-one-hundred-eighty-four/,N/A - Consolidated quotes appearing throughout the article.,"House Bronze Foundry 1972-2010 \n\nâ€œJerry House was a good friend who shared my interest in history. So of course we collected history together, which was not a big deal because neither of us had earned income to spare back in the late 60â€™s.â€ù â€“ Forrest Fenn \n\nIn December of 1968 a singular event in a war zone 8,500 miles away nearly altered the time space continuum of the art scene in the southwest United States. That was when Forrest Fenn, future Santa Fe gallery owner and arts benefactor almost didnâ€™t make it out of Southeast Asia alive. Had Forrest perished over the dense jungle canopy of Laos that month it is a given that Fenn Galleries would never have hatched onto the Santa Fe scene a few years later. It is equally unlikely that House Bronze, an acclaimed art foundry run by Jerry and Gail House, could possibly have emerged on the stubbornly dry, staked plain of Lubbock, Texas in 1972. \n\nIn January of 2010 Gail House was closing the doors on an art business she and her late husband Jerry operated since 1972. House Bronze Foundry occupied an unremarkable building in an unremarkable section of Lubbock, Texas. But what went on in this â€œplain Janeâ€ù building for the previous 38 years is indeed quite remarkable and has added significantly to the collections of art bronze statuary and monuments worldwide. Creating mostly large public statuary, House Bronze turned out bigger than life monuments of icons of our times including president George H. W. Bush, the astronaut Willie McCool and even a nine foot Rev. Billy Graham. They didnâ€™t just cast important folks though. They also made elephants and lions and bears and giant whatcha-ma-callits that adorn public gardens, university lawns, town squares, corporate entryways and great halls all over America. But it wasnâ€™t Jerry and Gailâ€™s dream to own an art foundry back in 1968. They both worked at Texas Tech University. In fact, large art bronzes probably werenâ€™t even anything they thought much more about than you or I do today. \n\nJerry collected guns and was interested in obtaining a smoothbore muzzle loaded firearm. Those things were expensive and the company told Jerry that if he could generate $5,000 in sales he would get a discount. So he was contacting everyone he knew that might be interested in buying a modern black powder gun. Black powder guns are a kind of unusual firearm. His list wasnâ€™t building rapidly. \n\nSomeone told Jerry that there was a pilot over at Reese Airbase, a Major by the name of Forrest Fenn and if Jerry could wait two months Forrest Fenn would be back from Vietnam and surely he would be interested in buying one. Jerry added Forrestâ€™s name to his list of hopefuls. \n\nNearly two months went by when Jerry heard the news that Forrest and his F-100 had been shot down and he might not be heading home. Jerry added a question mark after Forrestâ€™s name on his still incomplete list. \n\nIn 2010 Gail House was reminiscing about her late husband Jerry and his friendship with Forrest. She remembered when Forrest arrived back home from Vietnam. â€ùThe morning of the 26th, our phone rang and it was Forrest Fenn. A helicopter had picked him up not long after he was shot down, and because he was due home, he took the next Red Cross plane back.â€ù \n\nFor his part, Forrest wanted to make sure Jerry didnâ€™t scratch him off the buyerâ€™s list. He wanted that muzzle loader. \n\nâ€œWhen Jerry got the call from Forrest, we were stunned,â€ù Gail recalls. â€œJerry went over that day, and they formed a real friendship.â€ù \n\nAt the time, Forrest had started a part-time business in his garage where he was casting small bronzes for artists. Jerry was intrigued. More-so when Forrest told Jerry he could make a handsome ten dollars ($10) an hour doing this kind of work. That was the egg that Jerry later developed into his own foundry, House Bronze. \n\nForrest recalls that he was thrilled with his new black powder gun. â€œJerry and I knew how to load it: measure the powder and pour it down the barrel. Then tamp some wadding in. The round bullet was next, just roll it down the barrel. More wadding was added to keep the bullet from rolling out if you tilted the gun down.â€ù \n\nThey really wanted to shoot the thing because neither had done that before as Forrest remembers, â€œThe problem was that we didnâ€™t have any bullets. After looking around for a minute I found some old chewing gum that one of my young daughters had placed on the kitchen counter. It was dried and hard. I remember having to force it down the barrel with the ram-rod that came with the gun. Are you ready for this? Jerry took the first shot and that glob of chewing gum went clear through a 1â€ù board in my back yard fence. We couldnâ€™t believe it and Peggy couldnâ€™t stop laughing.â€ù \n\nSo now it was Forrestâ€™s turn to shoot and he put a small rock down the barrel and shot at the fence. â€œWhen the powder ignited our close proximity went black with smoke that chased my wife into the house. You are not going to believe this, but that little pebble came out of the barrel in pieces, and each one was impaled in my fence. There must have been 6 or 7 pieces. Jerry and I talked about that for a long time and considered telling the Army about our newly discovered secret weapon.â€ù \n\nThe camaraderie lasted well beyond their first muzzle loader experience. â€œJerry was a lot of fun. One of his legs was 2 inches shorter than the other, so he wore a shoe with an elevated sole. He bragged about it keeping him from being drafted. One thing you never did with Jerry, and that was to call him on the phone between 12:00 and 12:15 because that was when Paul Harvey was on the radio. Jerry was a fanatic about that guy, and he got me started listening. Paul, Jerry, and I had something in common. We were good, conservative, patriotic, American citizens.â€ù \n\nAfter a while, Forrest moved his foundry out of his garage, hired some help and started Fenn Bronze on the outskirts of Lubbock. â€œJerry used to come see me in my foundry, which was just a few blocks from where he worked. After a while he started helping me work waxes and get them ready to pour in bronze. He liked it, and was soon on my payroll. It wasnâ€™t long before he knew the business as well as anyone.â€ù \n\nAfter Forrest moved to Santa Fe, in 1972, Jerry opened his own casting studio with his wife Gail in Lubbock called House Bronze and did very well for 38 years. \n\nJerry and Forrest kept in touch. He was still working long hours at House Bronze and probably making considerably more than $10/hr when he died in 2009.\n"

I have to respect what the chief said... caused me to stop and think for a few days... after a long deliberation and discussions with friends, I have decided that stopping the search would not be fair to the thousands who have searched the Rockies and gone home with wonderful memories that will last them forever. A number of family members who have been estranged for years have reunited to join in the search... I will not stop the searching, but we are working with the state police and the search and rescue people to make it safer to hike the mountains... There is no way to prevent accidents.

But in the light of a recent accident, and in the interest of safety, I feel it necessary to alter that plan.\n\nThe treasure chest is not under water, nor is it near the Rio Grande River. It is not necessary to move large rocks or climb up or down a steep precipice, and it is not under a man-made object.\n\nPlease remember that I was about 80 when I made two trips from my vehicle to where I hid the treasure.\n\nPlease be cautious and donâ€™t take risks.\n\nMy guess is that in the last 7 years more than 250,000 people have searched for the treasure without suffering any serious injuries.

6338,6/16/17,http://mysteriouswritings.com/featured-question-with-forrest-fenn-on-the-thrill-of-the-chase-treasure-hunt-know-the-limits/,I am reading that several people have been lost while looking for your treasure. On Monday we will go on our first search and we are a little apprehensive. Since you are the only one who knows where it is hidden can you give me some advice that will help keep us safe? Mrs SRM and son.,"Yes Mrs. M, your email is timely, and because you are new to the search I will reiterate what has been said many times on blogs and in the media. If you plan to search in a National Forest or a National Park you should ask a ranger to brief you on your particular area. They can advise you much better than I can. \n\nIt is easier to get lost or stranded in the winter time because the weather is such a factor. But the spring and summer conditions can be just as unforgiving if you are not prepared. \n\nPlease donâ€™t ever overextend yourself. I was 80 or about when I hid the treasure and it was not a difficult task. I will soon be 87 and I could go back and get it if I were so inclined, I think. \n\nIf you or your son have any physical limitations please donâ€™t attempt the search. Many flatlanders suffer altitude sickness in the Rockies. \n\nDonâ€™t go into the mountains alone. Two searchers together is an absolute minimum, but three or even four is better. Stay within eyesight of each other. A whistle can be valuable if you get separated. \n\nFood, water, proper clothing, matches, bug spray, and a GPS are requirements. Cell phone service is not available in many mountain locations, but take one anyway. If you do have service check in with a friend at home several times a day, and give them a GPS location. They should know where and when you started your search and when you expect to return.\n\nWearing waders in fast moving water is dangerous, especially if you donâ€™t have the chest type with a tight belt around your chest that will keep most of the water out if you should fall. The rocks in most moving water are slippery and falling is easy. Your waders should have felt soles and not rubber. Donâ€™t take chances, and remember that in many cases no can be a better answer than yes. \n\nYou donâ€™t have to move big rocks, or scale a precipice to get to the treasure. Stay away from dangerous terrain. \n\nThe summer sun can sap your strength so it is best to wear long sleeves, long pants, and always a hat, especially in New Mexico. At the first sign of fatigue, turn back. If you are not camping plan to be out of the mountains before dark. If your solve is in the desert, get a new solve, and remember, much of the Rio Grande River is not in the Rocky Mountains. \n\nGenerally, black bears are not a problem, and they normally will run at first sight. The grizzly can be a problem but rarely is. If you are hiking, use your whistle so as to not surprise him. If you see cubs quickly move away. It is not a good idea to make eye contact with any dangerous animal because they may see it as a threat. Use bear spray only as a last resort. \n\nCaution and common sense are your best weapons in the mountains. Hope this helps Mrs. M, but you should also do your own research. f\n"

Things like that were almost expected. I thought he was a genius. He may have invented ESP if he had lived long enough.\n\nDuring the war my dad had a barn where we kept Bessie, our cow. Skippy was about 16 when he nailed a large, flat piece of tin to the wall and smeared it with cow manure to attract flies. He had an electrical gun that he plugged into the wall socket. When a fly landed on the tin Skippy would put the barrel of the gun about 10â€ù from the fly and pull the trigger. A spark miraculously shot at the fly and killed it. It was like a mini lightning bolt that made a loud PSSSSTT sound. Most of the time he missed the fly and had to move the lightning over a little. There were so many flies it didnâ€™t matter. The electrical smell always started our adrenalin pumping and we played war. The flies were German paratroopers who were landing to steal American secrets.\n\nIt was great fun and after a couple of days the â€œGeneralâ€ù stationed me by the gate to collect a nickel from each neighborhood kid who wanted to watch. For a dime they got to pull the trigger.\n\nSkippy tried to explain his secret gun theory to me.

It was a fascinating read for me, learning both about the Dalton peopleâ€™s site along the Mississippi in Southern Illinois and the New Madrid Fault. I continue to learn at least something new on a daily basis while on this journey.\n\nInterestingly, while researching The Olive Branch site, I learned about â€œThe Fenn Clovis Cacheâ€ù that I believe you purchased in 1988. I looked at photos of some of the amazing (56) stone artifacts, learning also that they are from an unknown (field) site near the borders of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. Is the Fenn Cache currently on display anywhere?\n\nI was going to try to sneak in your â€œhow deep is a hole?â€ù question also, but I will refrain, as perhaps I understand why you asked it.\n\nAs always, thank you.\nEllen","Good questions Ellen.\nI have not visited the Olive Branch site but I have several friends who have excavated there.\n\nHow I obtained the Fenn Cache maybe of interest to you. I was called by a local trader to look at the 56 large Clovis projectiles and preforms. They were affixed to a wooden frame. At first glance I told myself that they were too good to be real and I was about to reject them when I noticed the copper wire that held them to the frame was heavily patinated. I knew from my days casting art bronze that it takes many years for copper to reach that dark brown color, not unlike the color of an old penny. So I asked to take the pieces overnight for study.\n\nUpon high power magnification I discovered that each piece had minute traces of red ocher (hematite) in the flake scars, and was pretty sure that the pigment came from the Sunrise Red Ocher mine in Wyoming, a known Clovis site.\n\nFurther inspection revealed that amber mastic was present in the flutes of three obsidian points. It had been used to attach the projectiles to atlatl dart shafts.\n\nThat did it for me and I purchased the collection, which has since been published in numerous stories related to early man in North America. A book has been written about the collection and it has been widely exhibited at shows. It is now being studied at Texas A & M University. f"

C","Searchers have routinely revealed where they think the treasure was hidden and walked me through the process that took them on that course.

I have noticed in your book (â€œThe Thrill of the Chaseâ€ù) and heard in your interviews/book signings that you have quoted poets from Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) to William E. Henley; from Omar Khayyam and T.S. Eliot to your friend Evetts Haley.\nCould you possibly provide a â€œshort listâ€ù both of some of your favorite poets and your favorite poems? Have some poems been meaningful to you for a long time and others perhaps have been added to your â€œlistâ€ù more recently?\nThank you,\nEllen","Thanks Ellen, I like your questions.\n\nThere was a much celebrated musician who owned a very valuable Stradivarius violin. Once he played in Carnegie Hall to a packed crowd of black ties and bodice-laced dresses. The audience was rapt, enthralled, mesmerized. It was the greatest music they had ever heard.\n\nAt the conclusion of the concert, a standing ovation lasted fifteen minutes as the violinist accepted the accolades he so richly deserved. When everyone was finally seated again, the performer took the violin and smashed it over a chair, sending splinters careening into the second tier. A bourbon hush fell over the stunned crowd as the musician raised his bow and announced. â€œThat was not my Stradivarius, it isnâ€™t the violin, itâ€™s the violinist.â€ù\n\nI forgot what the question wasâ€_oh, now I remember.\n\nIn contrast, for me itâ€™s not so much the poet as it is the words. There are a few poems located somewhere in the back of my memory where I can pull them out on occasion, mostly for my own enjoyment. Much of the time I donâ€™t remember who wrote the words because I am not cultured enough to care, if the truth were known. An exception is Invictus by Henley, as you observed.\n\nThere is poetry for all occasions and sometimes I startle even myself with words that I can remember.

Were you concerned merely for damp conditions or is the Chest hidden in water? ~ Izcajun,"Thanks for the questions Izcajun. \n\nWhen I was ready to put the olive jar that contained my autobiography and two of my hairs in the treasure chest I studied the lid. It was made of tin coated steel, which is not easily oxidized in air or water. Over time those characteristics can break down. \n\nAlthough I am not ready to say the treasure is not in water, I certainly didnâ€™t want moisture to enter the jar. So I melted a chunk of microcrystalline wax to the point that it started smoking, which meant it was at its thinnest viscosity. Then I dipped the jar in the molten wax deep enough to cover the lid and part of the jar, and held it there for several seconds. I wanted the wax to seal the threads on both the lid and the jar, but I didnâ€™t want the heat to break the glass. After it cooled for a minute or so and the wax hardened, I repeated the process two times, increasing the wax thickness on the lid. The wax was petroleum based and wonâ€™t evaporate or deteriorate. When cold, it becomes brittle. Thatâ€™s why I wanted the threads on the lid and jar clogged. \n\nAll I know are the facts, if you want the truth go next door to the psychology department. f"

To misspell the word emphasized my point that having knowledge is, in fact, not as important as being resourceful. Also, when I make a mistake through ignorance that ploy gives me a degree of deniability that I routinely need. \n\nNow I will test you Wordsmith.

Itâ€™s my eulogy for Mike Kammerer. He was a man who stood singular in most crowds; a self-made man of rare bark who built a $15,000,000 home. When he died he left another $75,000,000 in a checking account in Jackson, Wyoming. He had three wives and his two divorces happened because he didnâ€™t know how to say he was sorry. He loved Peggyâ€™s hot muffins and often called her to ask if he could come to dinner. She always said yes. \n\nThis story was presented before about 300 close friends outside his home by his pool. It reveals what I thought of the man. It has been edited only slightly to fit this occasion.\n\nFinal Words for MK \n\nI wondered what I could say at a time like this about a man like Mike. And then I thought about the time he and Susan closed the Indian school at Santo Domingo Pueblo and took all of the children to the Natural History Museum in Albuquerque â€“ and then sat with them on the grass and ate pizza. \n\nAnd I thought about his support of the under appraised teenagers from Wyoming who come annually to camp at San Lazaro Pueblo to excavate and learn the disciplines of life. The hundred thousand dollars Mike invested in those young men and women paid dividends that continue to grow as they emerge from children at risk - to productive citizens. And when their transportation broke down Mike gave them a new seventeen passenger van. \n\nNothing about Mike Kammerer was common - rather he was a man of extremes - and his personality touched the spectrum at both ends. He was always full of new ideas - and no challenge was large enough to retard his charge. I remember his chase of Amelia Earhart - of nitrogen fuel cars - and of the plasma destruction process. I look back now with beautiful memories of a hundred lunches and dinners - and can still hear the melancholy echo of a thousand forgotten laughs. \n\nHis mind was like a bee in a meadow of spring flowers as he darted from one challenge to another - this beautiful home - his huge four engine airplane that could land in the middle of any ocean - and his relentless pursuit of the beautiful Susan Bodelson. \n\nEach of his projects was the best one - since the last one - or until the next one. Even so, his knowledge of the subjects he faced each day was conspicuously exceeded by his enthusiasm for what he was doing. His aspirations were huge - and his relentlessness - his impatience with conditions which impeded or slowed his progress was matched only by his over flowing reservoir of vitality. \n\nMike was happiest when he was under his cowboy hat. During the last ten days of his life I lunched with him twice and each time he wore his hat and roping boots and spurs. When I asked about wearing spurs in the restaurant - he just spread a wide grin at me. That was Mike all over. \n\nOn the 9th of May, he and Susan went into their bedroom to watch a movie. He said that he would be content to spend the rest of his life with her between those four walls. And when he was slumped at her feet he was still wearing his roping boots and spurs. He never opened his eyes again but he was where he wanted to be - at home, with the one he loved. I know he still has a smile in his heart, and I hope his hat and boots and spurs are with him now, as he strikes his final trail. \n\nThere was a high octane quality about Mike â€“ an overt, manly charm. But what his good friend Sally Denton remembered most were his â€œincredible blue eyes that could alternate from an impenetrable glacial lake to the most inviting Caribbean lagoon.â€ù Those are her words, not mine! \n\nDuring these last two years Susan was a moderating force in Mikeâ€™s life and he told me just a few days ago that he wanted to be a better person, - a better husband - a better father â€“ a better friend. \n\nHe said that when he was a young man his father was displeased with him - and thought he was worthless - and asked what he had done in the last year that was worthwhile. Mike just said, â€œWell, I made a million dollars for one thing.â€ù \n\nMike was at his best when he was quiet and reflective and we often spoke of ways to simplify our lives. But fickle is the finger that points at winners - so we find ourselves here today to celebrate the life of Mike Kammerer. And although he has passed from our view he will never fade from our memory. His childish, giddy laugh was volcanic and could erupt and spread across his face like a tidal wave â€“ making you laugh and want to be with him. \n\nSo now, I sense Mikeâ€™s agreeing presence and remember him as being a man of great vision that was taken from us in the moment of his greatest blossom - and left us with a grove of evaporated hopes and demolished dreams. But from Mikeâ€™s seeds have grown a beautiful symphony of creative combinations in the form of his children - Rudy and Kristen, and their life partners, Yvonne and Tina. And while the world is poorer with the passing of Mike Kammerer we are still blessed to have his wife Susan and her children - David, Corinne, Perry and the wonderful Eric. We are thankful to have wallowed in Mikeâ€™s brilliance for a time that was way too short. But all things that belong to man change, and we must be part of that change, however painful it is. \n\nFor life is a game of poker, \nAnd happiness is the pot. \nFate deals you four cards and a joker, \nAnd you play whether you like it or not. \n\nIn closing let me say that I hope your memories of that indelible man are as vivid as mine. If you look into the full moon you may see him sitting beside the great council fires of history - arguing with Rasputin - or Shakespeare â€“ or Sitting Bull. All of that is within him.

It also was my goal to get the kids off the couch and out of the game room and into the mountains where they can smell the sunshine. Our kids are obese and pine away their time playing computer games or texting. There is a wonderful and mysterious world out there to be discovered. We have a problem with our youth and all of us are to blame. The hidden treasure is my way of giving families an opportunity that might bring them together with a focus and a goal. I also wanted to give hope to every redneck out there who has a wife and 12 kids, a pick-up truck, lost his job and needs some hope... That was my original plan because I thought I was dying of cancer, he told Metro. After losing a kidney, I was given a 20 per cent chance of living three years. But now I donâ€™t know. If I am again diagnosed with a terminal disease I would like for my bones to be with the treasure... I have never said what I thought the treasure is worth because I donâ€™t know. I have not said it is buried. I said that I hid it. But that is not to say it is not buried. I just didnâ€™t want to give that as a clue. There have been some who have been within 500 feet because they have told me where they have been. Others have figured the first two clues and went right past the treasure and didnâ€™t know it... He is my hero. So many people have lived vicariously through the dashing things he did. There must be pirates in my ancestry someplace... There are three kinds of people. There are those who make things happen, there are those who watch things happen and there are those who donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening. The train doesnâ€™t go past the banana tree but one time so I want to reach out and grab every banana I can."

Since you have spent much time in the west around Yellowstone, do you have any personal experiences with cattle ranching and cattle drives? Franklin","Franklin, Many years ago, my good friend J. Evetts Haley (the writer), invited me to help him brand calves on his ranch in the panhandle of Texas. It was 103 degrees in August and they built a big fire to heat the branding irons. There was no cooling breeze. After the cowboys roped a calf, it was my job to run up and throw the poor thing on its side. I think every one of those critters kicked me in the nose. After the branding, the calf jumped up and ran off, and I had to do it all over again. That day was so hot and sweaty I lost 6 pounds. All of my aspirations for being a rancher were used up that day and I never wanted to see a branding iron again. Please tell your students to study hard so they donâ€™t have to grow up to be a cowboy. f"

He used to do a big train whistle out of town so my grandmother could hear to let him know he was on the way, and sheâ€™d tell me to take off running. I would run like the dickens through the bramble, and meet his train on the edge of Lewistown, Mt., and he would stop it to a complete halt, then let me on, and I got to drive the train all the way through Lewistown, Mt., then I would hop off, with the train building steam and run back to grandmaâ€™s house. Never fell once. I remember the train would slow down slow, then come to a complete halt like how I think warm waters halt. \n\nOne of my favorite things to do is go in to town and have lunch with the â€œyoung hobosâ€ù who hop the trains out of Colorado Springs. My Sunday hobo church. They grab food from people coming out of the cafes and eat it up like morsels form heaven. Took me only a day to adjust to their routine. They are brilliant poets, just like Forrest. A few are banjo players, and they are peaceful, but not for the meek. They are totally free to ride the rails to the next adventure, and I live vicariously through them, as I also love the rails.

7094,6/19/13,https://dalneitzel.com/2013/06/19/forrest-gets-mail-4/,"Hi Forrest!\n\nI wanted to share with you my adventure in trying to find the treasure. The general thought around Yellowstone is only crazy people are looking for it and it is a hoax.\n\nAfter 2 trips, 5 days looking in a concentrated area. Iâ€™m beginning to wonder. If anything, the treasure has been found or I have been within 100 feet of it. \n\nMy first trip turned into a search and rescue effort that seems to have made my name a household word around Yellowstone. 2 nights that each one of them could have killed meâ€_long story and amazing what the human body can endure to survive. 20 people went looking for me and they found me walking out. Then took 4 people to jerry rig a line to cross the Yellowstone River too retrieve my pack that I had to cut to get out of the place where I spent my first night. They couldnâ€™t go down where I went up, Dangerous is an understatement. You might have had a visit from my wife and dad had I not returned and I donâ€™t think it would have been pretty. This time I thought the treasure could be on a little island upstream from Gardiner. Nope! \n\nSo further research refined. Words like bluff, crack (crevice), Knowles Falls (wise â€“ butterfly â€“ flutterby) starting coming to life for me. The marbles and the miner looking down while two people are now pointing to the third marble. At first I took the image literally but after a day of tromping around over each bluff and valley leading up to Knowles Falls I realized I missed something. Then I realized the image was reversed and the bluff I needed to get to was not easy to get to. But the next day I did. I walked the big bluff, the little bluff next to it and the two bluffs below it. (half way up the bluff) I got some great pictures and saw a really unique rock formation that could draw unwanted attention. Saw a lot of trees and rocks but I didnâ€™t see the treasure. I also expected to see perhaps a marking on a tree by Joe Meek who travelled around this area as he escaped the Indians. I did see a bear and her cub. That was scary. I didnâ€™t see any marking like a headstoneâ€_I presume grandmaâ€™s headstone. Iâ€™m thinking grandma must be related to either Joe Meek or Mr. Knowles. But I looked all over that area overlooking Knowles Falls and Crevice Creek. No luck. Last night climbing out of that area I made a wrong turn on a mountain. So getting dark I set for the night on a side of a hill. My friend couldnâ€™t traverse the whole distance on the 3rd day and waiting for me with a plan in mind. I missed my deadline and so once again the search and rescue started setting up a search. Fortunately, I got back to my car by 8:00 AM. Fortunately, my wife and dad werenâ€™t called. Needless to say, either the treasure has been found or it is a hoax. If I have missed it, the path must be down off Rescue Creek Trail to the river line and then up to Knowles Falls â€“ perhaps a little beyond from the other side but consistent with the marbles picture it would have to be a lower bluff closer to Crevice Creek. Needless to say, my wife wonâ€™t be letting me make this trek again. Sheâ€™s probably going to make me unwind my business. Another casualty of the recession. Needless to say, I tried and feel like I just didnâ€™t see the right tree. It may not be in a dangerous place, but the switches make it a dangerous adventure. \n\nIn closing, I hope it is real. I feel I have solved the puzzle, but it is not there. Risking my life a 3rd time just isnâ€™t an option. In closing you got me. I wish I could say I was right there because I solved it and thatâ€™s good enough like you telling the lady if she could tell you where it was, you would go get it for her. The Thrill of the Hunt was more like an mission gone awry x2. \n\nIn the end, you got me. \n\nSincerely, Randolph","Randolph, No need to search any place where a 79 or 80 year old man could not carry a 42 pound box full of gold.

The swivet was cruel I think, but ok, your book your rules. Ive used money I need to survive with thinking im almost there, Iâ€™m almost there. Ive been persistant, diligent, and Iâ€™m worn to a nub.

Are you dead? \n\nThere is now a record of the threat, by whom. If he gets in my face again in a threatening manner I am going to pull my bowie knife out and cut his throat open from ear to ear.

It might save folks some grief to know for sure whether this is really buried or not. I know you have indicated pretty strongly that it is not, but not exactly been firm about it. For example, I have seen several folks at the Dunn Bridge and at the Red River Hatchery (another popular place with searchers) carrying in shovels. I try to explain they probably donâ€™t need them, but that usually goes over their heads.  Anyway, thanks for the adventure.

7185,8/1/13,https://dalneitzel.com/2013/08/01/forrest-gets-friendly-mail/,And Finallyâ€_An artist friend of Forrestâ€™s has a show scheduled in Santa Fe for October. Since Forrest had been in the art business for many years he was asked what advice he had to share in preparation for the show. This is Forrestâ€™s reply.,"It is the responsibility of the artist to present a product that the consuming public wants to buy. Thatâ€™s the main thing, and the hardest part. Galleries in Santa Fe go out of business every week because they are trying to sell something that they like personally. Itâ€™s a fast poison.  \n\nItâ€™s OK for an artist to have romantic notions in his studio about who he is but lets face it, an artist is little more than a manufacturer in the business sense. Art is a commodity and should be treated as such, except when speaking with a client. \n\nOne bad painting hanging with good ones ruins the whole show. Just do not show anything that is not your best work. \n\nIt is the responsibility of the gallery to pull the public in to look at the art. It can be done by having a dynamic speaker talk for 15 minutes. (no longer) That speaker should be someone whose name will attract listeners and thus, expose them to the art. Ask Paul Hutton to talk about a subject related to your work. Johnny Boggs should be there with his titles for sale. \n\nAnd most important, someone must sell the art. Expensive things are rarely purchased â€“ they are nearly always sold. There is a distinct difference. When I walk into a gallery and someone looks up from a computer and says, â€œLet me know if I can help you.â€ù That means he doesnâ€™t have time for me, so instead of spending $100,000 on a painting, I walk out, not wanting to interrupt a computer game. \n\nSelling means you need someone who is attractive, eloquent, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and extroverted. That person is lacking at your gallery, which means you should bring someone with you, even if you have to hire that person for three hours from another gallery. \n\nThe artist should try to meet people at his show but not be actively involved in selling until the deal is almost made. Then such comments as, â€œI think this is one of my best paintings,â€ù â€œThis is one of two paintings that my mother wanted to keep but I talked her into taking the other one because I needed this one to dress up my show,â€ù Joseph Sharp, when a buyer balked, would say, â€œHow foolish of a man to wait, when once his chance is nigh, tomorrow may be too late, some other man may buy.â€ù \n\nSoft western music in the background can add ambience, but softly. Mood is important. When someone wants to think about a painting, that means no, not maybe. \n\nLighting is critical. Your gallery murders paintings with light. Lights should be on reostats and turned down until the painting warms.  \n\nServe a drink thatâ€™s different. What about sarsaparilla? Iâ€™m serious, and make a big deal about how important it was in the 1850s. \n\nPut a few sold stickers on paintings you think wonâ€™t sell, or two that you donâ€™t want to sell. Look successful. \n\nDo you know someone who will loan a CMR or Remington painting to hang with yours? \n\nEach painting should have itâ€™s own focus, like it will be seen in someoneâ€™s home, not up near the ceiling. \n\nDonâ€™t invite friends who you know will not buy a painting. They crowd buyers away from the walls. Invite those who will make you look important, even if you know they wonâ€™t buy. \n\nTalk to EVERY client. Talk about whether thatâ€™s a â€™73 model Winchester or a 66 model. If there is history going on in the painting talk about it.\n\nComplement people who like your work. If someone has a â€œgood eyeâ€ù because they have one of your paintings, maybe they will have a better eye if they have two. Tell them that in a way that is not pushy.\n\nAsk a client to take one of your paintings home and hang it for a month on approval. See if it fits. If not, tell them you will send someone over to pick it up. Make sure he lights it properly.\n\nA client with two of your paintings is not a collector, but one with three is. Bring some small â€œthank-you, giveaway paintings,â€ù to let your buyer know he is more than a sales slip to you. Giving costs you very little; not selling costs you plenty.\n\nTell a buyer to pay your retail price and take it home for a year. After that he can bring it back for full refund. Worse case scenario is that you get to use his money for a year, and hopefully the painting will have appreciated. it so you win twice if he brings it back because you can go up 25% and sell it again.\n\nWhen shipping a painting on approval donâ€™t ever use a box wherein the painting can be returned. If the guy doesnâ€™t want your painting make him go get his own crate. Sometimes they will keep the painting instead. Itâ€™s a percentage.\n\nI could go on but I think I sold myself one of your paintings so I am headed to the gallery so I can pick the best one. f"
